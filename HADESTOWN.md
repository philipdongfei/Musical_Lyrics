# HADESTOWN

## SYNOPSIS

Act I

As in the 2010 album, Hadestown adapts the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to a Great Depression-era inspired post-apocalyptic setting. The musical opens with the three Fates describing the setting ("Any Way the Wind Blows"), after which Hermes, the narrator, enters to introduce each of the characters ("Road to Hell"). The stage empties, leaving only Orpheus and Eurydice. The two introduce themselves to each other, and Orpheus asks Eurydice to marry him ("Come Home With Me"). Eurydice is doubtful, since they both live in poverty and she wants a life of stability. Orpheus persuades her by telling her that his music will provide for them ("Wedding Song").

After an interlude in which Orpheus tells the story of Hades and Persephone ("Epic (Part I)"), Persephone enters to celebrate the summertime with Orpheus and Eurydice ("Living It Up On Top"). Orpheus makes a toast to Persephone and expresses hope for his future with Eurydice, who reflects on her growing love for Orpheus despite her independence ("All I've Ever Known"). The two promise to stay with each other no matter what hardships they face.

Winter comes, and along with it a train to bring Persephone back to Hadestown – Hades' underground factory. Orpheus and Eurydice watch as Persephone voices her misery at having to return to the factory, while the Fates appear to praise Hadestown's riches. Orpheus condemns Hades' treatment of his workers, but Eurydice is intrigued ("Way Down Hadestown"). As winter progresses, Orpheus continues to write music while Eurydice urges him to work so they can have food and shelter. At the same time, Hades and Persephone fight about the decline of their own relationship ("Epic (Part II)/Chant").

Hades leaves the factory to find someone who will appreciate the safety and comfort of Hadestown. He comes across Eurydice and asks her to join him in Hadestown ("Hey Little Songbird"). The Fates arrive, and urge Eurydice to put her survival first ("When the Chips are Down"). With Orpheus away working on his music, Eurydice decides to follow Hades to the factory ("Gone, I'm Gone"). When Orpheus returns to look for Eurydice, Hermes tells him that she's gone to Hadestown and tells Orpheus how to get there without using Hades' train ("Wait For Me"). Eurydice arrives at Hadestown, and begins her work on the wall surrounding it ("Why We Build the Wall").


Act II

Following an entr'acte where Persephone introduces herself and the band, and serves drinks to the audience ("Our Lady Of The Underground"), we see Eurydice realizing the true consequences of her choice to come to Hadestown: she can never leave unless Hades chooses to let her go ("Way Down Hadestown II"). After signing her contract with Hades, she sings of her regrets with allusions to a sexual assault ("Flowers").

Orpheus, having made his way to Hadestown following Hermes' directions, finds Eurydice and begs her to come home and marry him. Eurydice and the Fates tell Orpheus that she legally belongs to Hades and can't return without his permission ("Come Home With Me II"). Hades arrives, and Orpheus confronts him. Hades asserts that he does own Eurydice, and attempts to chase Orpheus off his property ("Papers"). The Fates surround an exhausted Orpheus and tell him to give up on saving Eurydice ("Nothing Changes"). Orpheus sings of his despair at losing Eurydice, which Persephone overhears ("If It's True"). Touched by Orpheus' music, Persephone tells Hades to let Eurydice go ("How Long"). Hades offers to give Orpheus a chance to sing for him ("Chant II"). Orpheus sings a version of the song he'd been writing when Eurydice left, reminding Hades of his love for Persephone ("Epic (Part III)"). Hades is affected more than he had expected, and the Fates explain his dilemma: if he keeps Eurydice captive, she becomes a martyr, but if he lets her go, then he loses his authoritarian control over the factory ("Word to the Wise"). He decides to leave their fate in Orpheus' hands: the couple can leave together, but Orpheus has to lead them out. If he turns to see if Eurydice is following him, she will belong to Hades forever ("His Kiss, The Riot").

Hermes explains Hades' decision to Orpheus and Eurydice, who discuss all of their doubts with the hope of being able to trust one another on their way out ("Promises"). Orpheus begins the walk out of Hadestown with Eurydice following him, guided in part by the Fates ("Wait for Me II"). Orpheus makes it right up until the very end of the journey, when he is overcome with doubt and turns to look for Eurydice – only to see that she's been right behind him all along, thus condemning her to stay in Hadestown forever ("Doubt Comes In"). Hermes leads Eurydice back to Hadestown ("Road to Hell II"), and the show closes with Persephone raising a toast to Orpheus ("I Raise My Cup").

Synopsis to Hadestown musical

## Any Way the Wind Blows

FATES <br>
In the fever of a world in flames <br>
In the season of the hurricanes <br>
Flood will get you if the fire don’t <br> 
Any way the wind blows <br>

And there ain’t a thing that you can do <br>
When the weather takes a turn on you <br> 
‘Cept for hurry up and hit the road <br> 
Any way the wind blows <br>

Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route <br>
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south <br>
Ain’t nobody gonna stick around <br>
When the dark clouds roll <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>

In the valley of the exodus <br>
In the belly of a bowl of dust <br>
Crows and buzzards flying low <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>

No use talking of the past, it’s passed <br>
Set out walking and you don’t look back <br>
Where you’re goin’ there ain’t no one knows <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>

Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route <br>
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south <br>
Gone the same way as the shantytown <br>
And the traveling show <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>

## Road to Hell

HERMES <br>
Once upon a time there was a railroad line <br>
Don’t ask where, brother, don’t ask when <br>
It was a road to Hell—No! It was hard times <br>
It was a world of gods and men <br>
 <br>
HERMES & COMPANY <br>
It’s an old song <br>
It’s an old tale from way back when <br>
It’s an old song <br>
But we’re gonna sing it again <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
Now on the road to Hell there was a railroad line <br>
And there were three old women all dressed the same <br>
And they was always singin’ in the back of your mind <br>
Everybody meet the Fates! <br>
 <br>
Now on the road to Hell there was a railroad station <br>
And a man with feathers on his feet <br>
Who would help you to your final destination <br>
Mr. Hermes - that’s me! <br>
 <br>
HERMES & COMPANY <br>
It’s a sad song <br>
It’s a sad tale, it’s a tragedy <br>
It’s a sad song <br>
But we sing it anyway <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
Now, on the road to Hell there was a railroad line <br>
And a lady steppin' off a train <br>
With a suitcase full of summertime <br>
Persephone, by name <br>
 <br>
There was a railroad line on the road to Hell <br>
There was a young man down on a bended knee <br>
And brother, thus begins the tale <br>
Of Orpheus and Eurydice! <br>
 <br>
HERMES & COMPANY <br>
It’s a love song <br>
It’s a tale of a love that never dies <br>
It’s a love song <br>
About someone who tries <br>

## Epic 1  

 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
King of diamonds, king of spades <br>
Hades was king of the kingdom of dirt <br>
Miners of mines, diggers of graves <br>
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work <br>
And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat <br>
Who paid them their wages and set them about <br>
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths <br>
Of the earth to turn its insides out, singing <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
King of mortar, king of bricks <br>
The River Styx was a river of stones <br>
And Hades laid them high and thick <br>
With a million hands that were not his own <br>
And a million feet that fell in line <br>
And stepped in time with Hades’ step <br>
And a million minds that were just one mind <br>
Like stones in a row <br>
Stone by stone <br>
Row by row <br>
The river rose up, singing <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
 <br>

## All I've Ever Know 

 <br>
[Eurydice]: <br>
I was alone so long <br>
Didn't even know that I was lonely <br>
 <br>
Out in the cold so long <br>
Didn't even know that I was cold <br>
Turn my collar to the wind <br>
This is how it's always been <br>
 <br>
All I've ever known is how to hold my own <br>
 <br>
All I've ever known is how to hold my own <br>
but now I want to hold you too <br>
 <br>
 <br>
You take me in your arms <br>
And suddenly there's sunlight all around <br>
Everything bright and warm <br>
Shining like it never did before <br>
And for a moment I forget <br>
Just how dark and cold it gets <br>
 <br>
All I've ever known is how to hold my own <br>
 <br>
All I've ever known is how to hold my own <br>
but now I want to hold you <br>
Hold you close, I don't want to ever have to let you go <br>
Now I want to hold you, hold you tight <br>
I don't want to go back to the moonlight <br>
 <br>
Say that you'll hold me forever <br>
Say that the wind won't change on us <br>
Say that we'll stay with each other <br>
That it will always be like this <br>
 <br>
[Orpheus]: <br>
I want to hold you forever <br>
The wind will never change on us <br>
As long as we stay with each other <br>
It will always be like this <br>
 <br>

## Way Down Hadestown 

 <br>
HERMES <br>
Follow that dollar for a long way down <br>
Far away from the poorhouse door <br>
Either get to hell or to Hadestown <br>
Ain’t no difference anymore <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
Hound dog howl and the whistle blow <br>
Train comes a-rollin, clickety-clack <br>
Nobody knows where that old train goes <br>
Those who go they don’t come back <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Winter’s nigh and summer’s o’er <br>
I hear that high and lonesome sound <br>
Of my husband coming for <br>
To bring me home to Hadestown <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Everybody dresses in clothes so fine <br>
Everybody’s pockets are weighted down <br>
Everybody sipping ambrosia wine <br>
In a goldmine in Hadestown <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Everybody hungry, everybody tired <br>
Everybody slaves by the sweat of his brow <br>
The wage is nothing and the work is hard <br>
It’s a graveyard in Hadestown <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
Every little penny in the wishing well <br>
Every little nickel on the drum <br>
All them shiny little heads and tails <br>
Where do you think they come from? <br>
They come from way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS & HERMES <br>
Mister Hades is a mean old boss <br>
With a silver whistle and a golden scale <br>
An eye for an eye! <br>
And he weighs the cost <br>
A lie for a lie! <br>
And your soul for sale <br>
Sold! <br>
To the king on the chromium throne <br>
Thrown! <br>
To the bottom of a sing-sing cell <br>
Where the little wheel squeal and the big wheel groan <br>
And you better forget about your wishing well <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Mr. Hades is a mighty king <br>
Must be making some mighty big deals <br>
Seems like he owns everything <br>
Kind of makes you wonder how it feels <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
Way down under the ground <br>
 <br>

## Epct 2 

 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Heavy and hard is the heart of the king <br>
King of iron, king of steel <br>
The heart of the king loves everything <br>
Like the hammer loves the nail <br>
 <br>
But the heart of a man is a simple one <br>
Small and soft, flesh and blood <br>
And all that it loves is a woman <br>
A woman is all that it loves <br>
 <br>
And Hades is king of the scythe and the sword <br>
He covers the world in the color of rust <br>
He scrapes the sky and scars the earth <br>
And he comes down heavy and hard on us <br>
 <br>
But even that hardest of hearts unhardened <br>
Suddenly, when he saw her there <br>
Persephone in her mother’s garden <br>
Sun on her shoulders, wind in her hair <br>
 <br>
The smell of the flowers she held in her hand <br>
And the pollen that fell from her fingertips <br>
And suddenly Hades was only a man <br>
With a taste of nectar upon his lips, singing: <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>

## Epic (Part II) / Chant 

 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
King of diamonds, king of spades <br>
Hades was king of a kingdom of dirt <br>
Miners of mines, diggers of graves <br>
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work <br>
 <br>
And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat <br>
Who paid them their wages and set them about <br>
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths of the earth <br>
To turn its insides out, singing: <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
King of mortar, kings of bricks <br>
The river Styx was a river of stones <br>
And Hades laid them high and thick <br>
With a million hands that were not his own <br>
 <br>
And a million feet that fell in line <br>
That stepped in time with Hades’ step <br>
And a million minds that were just one mind <br>
Like stones in a row, <br>
And stone by stone, <br>
Row by row, <br>
The river rose up, singing: <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>

## Hey Little Songbird 

 <br>
HADES <br>
Hey, little songbird, give me a song <br>
I’m a busy man and I can’t stay long <br>
I got clients to call, I got orders to fill <br>
I got walls to build, I got riots to quell <br>
And they’re giving me hell back in Hades <br>
Hey, little songbird, cat got your tongue? <br>
Always a pity for one so pretty and young <br>
When poverty comes to clip your wings <br>
And knock the wind right out of your lungs <br>
Hey, nobody sings on empty <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Strange is the call of this strange man <br>
I want to fly down and feed at his hand <br>
I want a nice soft place to land <br>
I wanna lie down forever <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
Hey, little songbird, you got something fine <br>
You’d shine like a diamond down in the mine <br>
And the choice is yours if you’re willing to choose <br>
Seeing as you’ve got nothing to lose <br>
And I could use a canary <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Suddenly nothing is as it was <br>
Where are you now, Orpheus? <br>
Wasn’t it always the two of us <br>
Weren’t we birds of a feather? <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
Hey, little songbird, let me guess <br>
He’s some kind of poet and he’s penniless <br>
Give him your hand, he’ll give you his hand-to-mouth <br>
He’ll write you a poem when the power’s out <br>
Hey, why not fly south for the winter? <br>
Hey, little songbird, look all around you <br>
See how the vipers and vultures surround you <br>
They’ll take you down, they’ll pick you clean <br>
If you stick around such a desperate scene <br>
See people get mean when the chips are down <br>
 <br>

## When the Chips are Down 

 <br>
FATES <br>
Life ain’t easy, life ain’t fair <br>
A girl’s gotta fight for a rightful share <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
Help yourself, to hell with the rest <br>
Even the one who loves you best <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Oh my aching heart <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
Take if you can, give if you must <br>
Ain’t nobody but yourself to trust <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
Aim for the heart, shoot to kill <br>
If you don’t do it then the other one will <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
And the first shall be first <br>
And the last shall be last <br>
Cast your eyes to heaven <br>
You get a knife in the back <br>
Nobody’s righteous <br>
Nobody’s proud <br>
Nobody’s innocent <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
Now that the <br>
Now that the <br>
Now that the <br>
Now that the <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>

## Gone, I'm Gone 

 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Orpheus, my heart is yours <br>
Always was and will be <br>
It’s my gut I can’t ignore <br>
Orpheus, I’m hungry <br>
Oh, my heart, it aches to stay <br>
But the flesh will have its way <br>
Oh, the way is dark and long <br>
I’m already gone, I’m gone <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
Go ahead and lay the blame <br>
Talk of virtue, talk of sin <br>
Wouldn’t you have done the same? <br>
In her shoes, in her skin <br>
You can have your principles <br>
When you’ve got a bellyful <br>
But hunger has a way with you <br>
There’s no telling what you’re gonna do <br>
When the chips are down <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
What you gonna do when the chips are down? <br>
Now that the chips are down <br>
 <br>
 <br>

## Wait For Me 

 <br>
HERMES <br>
How to get to Hadestown <br>
You’ll have to take the long way down <br>
Through the underground, under cover of night <br>
Laying low, staying out of sight <br>
Ain’t no compass, brother, there ain’t no map <br>
Just a telephone wire and the railroad track <br>
Keep on walking and you don’t look back <br>
’Til you get to the bottomland <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming <br>
Wait, I’m coming with you <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming too <br>
I’m coming too <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
River Styx is high and wide <br>
Cinderbricks and razorwire <br>
Walls of iron and concrete <br>
Hound dogs howling round the gate <br>
Them dogs’ll lay down and play dead <br>
If you got the bones, if you got the bread <br>
But if all you got is your own two legs <br>
You best be glad you got ’em <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming <br>
Wait, I’m coming with you <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming too <br>
I’m coming too <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
You’re on the lam, you’re on the run <br>
Don’t give your name, you don’t have one <br>
And don’t look no one in the eye <br>
That town will try to suck you dry <br>
They’ll suck your brain, they’ll suck your breath <br>
They’ll pluck the heart right out your chest <br>
They’ll truss you up in your Sunday best <br>
And stuff your mouth with cotton <br>
 <br>
OPHEUS <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming <br>
Wait, I’m coming with you <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming too <br>
I’m coming <br>
Wait, wait, wait, wait <br>
 <br>

## Why We Build the Wall 

 <br>
HADES <br>
Why do we build the wall, my children, my children? <br>
Why do we build the wall? <br>
 <br>
ALL TOGETHER <br>
Why do we build the wall? <br>
We build the wall to keep us free <br>
That’s why we build the wall <br>
We build the wall to keep us free <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
How does the wall keep us free, my children, my children? <br>
How does the wall keep us free? <br>
 <br>
ALL TOGETHER <br>
How does the wall keep us free? <br>
The wall keeps out the enemy <br>
And we build the wall to keep us free <br>
That’s why we build the wall <br>
We build the wall to keep us free <br>

HADES <br>
Who do we call the enemy, my children, my children? <br>
Who do we call the enemy? <br>
 <br>
ALL TOGETHER <br>
Who do we call the enemy? <br>
The enemy is poverty <br>
And the wall keeps out the enemy <br>
And we build the wall to keep us free <br>
That’s why we build the wall <br>
We build the wall to keep us free <br>

We have a wall to work upon <br>
We have work and they have none <br>
And our work is never done <br>

## Our Lady of the Underground 

 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
I don’t know about you, boys <br>
But if you’re like me, then hanging around <br>
This old manhole is bringing you down <br>
Six-feet-under getting under your skin <br>
Cabin fever is a-setting in <br>
You’re stir crazy! You’re stuck in a rut! <br>
Or you could use a little pick-me-up <br>
I can give you what it is you crave <br>
A little something from the good old days <br>
I got the wind right here in a jar <br>
I got the rain on tap at the bar <br>
I got sunshine up on the shelf <br>
Allow me to introduce myself <br>
 <br>
Brother, what’s my name? <br>
My name is… <br>
 <br>
CROWD <br>
Our Lady of the Underground! <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Brother, what’s my name? <br>
 <br>
CROWD <br>
Our Lady of Ways! <br>
Our Lady of Means! <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Brother, what’s my name? <br>
My name is… <br>
 <br>
CROWD <br>
Our Lady of the Upside Down <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Brother what’s my name? <br>
I’ll tell you my name… <br>
Persephone! <br>
 <br>
Come here, brother, let me guess <br>
It’s the little things you miss <br>
Spring flowers, autumn leaves <br>
Ask me, brother, and you shall receive <br>
Or maybe these just ain’t enough <br>
Maybe you’re looking for some stronger stuff <br>
I got a sight for the sorest eye <br>
When’s the last time you saw the sky? <br>
Wipe away your tears, brother <br>
Brother, I know how you feel <br>
I can see you’re blinded by the sadness of it all <br>
But look a little closer, everything will be revealed <br>
Look a little closer, there’s a crack in the wall <br>
 <br>
You want stars? I got a skyful <br>
Put a quarter in the slot, you’ll get an eyeful <br>
You want the moon? I got her too <br>
She’s right here waiting in my pay-per-view <br>
Oh, how long’s it been? <br>
A little moonshine ain’t no sin <br>
One at a time, boys, straight line <br>
What the boss don’t know, the boss won’t mind <br>
 <br>

## Way Down Hadestown II 

 <br>
HERMES <br>
Now in Hadestown there was a lot of souls <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Low, keep your head, keep your head <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
Working on the wall with all their might <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Oh, you gotta keep your head <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
You see, they kept their heads down low <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
If you wanna keep your head <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
You couldn’t quite see their faces right <br>
Oh, but you could hear them singing: <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Low, keep your head, keep your head <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
Swinging their hammers in the cold, hard ground <br>
You could hear the sound of the pickaxe a-ringing <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
One! Two! If you wanna keep your head <br>
 <br>
HERMES & COMPANY <br>
They called it “freedom” <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
I’m free! We’re free! <br>
Mr. Hades set us free! <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
Mr. Hades set you free <br>
To work yourself into the ground <br>
Free to spend eternity <br>
In the factory <br>
And the warehouse <br>
Where the whistles scream <br>
And the foreman shouts <br>
And you’re punchin' in <br>
And punchin' in <br>
And punchin' in <br>
And you can’t punch out! <br>
 <br>
FATES (COMPANY) <br>
You're way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head) <br>
Way down under the ground! <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
But I don’t understand... you said this was the promised land! <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
You sell your soul, <br>
You get your due! <br>
That is all we promised you! <br>
 <br>
Heard that mighty trumpet sound, <br>
Crossed the river to the Other Side, <br>
Thought you’d lay your burdens down <br>
And rest in peace in Paradise <br>
But there ain’t no rest for your weary soul <br>
Hades keeps you toiling <br>
 <br>
HADES & FATES <br>
Shoveling coal in a big black hole to keep his boiler boiling <br>
 <br>
FATES (COMPANY) <br>
Way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head) <br>
Way down under the ground! <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
But don’t you see? <br>
It’s different with me! <br>
 <br>
FATES (spoken) <br>
Different than who? They thought they were different too! <br>
(sings) <br>
Down in the river of oblivion <br>
You kissed your little life goodbye <br>
And Hades laid his hands on you <br>
And gave you everlasting life! <br>
And everlasting overtime <br>
In the mine, the mill, and the machinery <br>
Running his old assembly line <br>
From Pluto to the Pleiades <br>
 <br>
FATES (COMPANY) <br>
Way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low) <br>
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head) <br>
Way down under the ground! <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (yelling) <br>
There must be some mistake! <br>
 <br>
FATES (spoken) <br>
Oh, it was a mistake alright! <br>
And now you gotta pay- <br>
And pay- <br>
And pay for it, for the rest of your life! <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
See, it’s like I said before: a lot can happen behind closed doors. <br>
Eurydice was a hungry young girl, but she wasn’t hungry anymore. <br>
What she was, instead, was dead- <br>
Dead to the world, anyway. <br>
See, she went behind those doors <br>
And signed her life away. <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
Saw that wheel up in the sky <br>
Heard the big bell tolling <br>
A lot of souls have gotta die <br>
To keep the Rust Belt rolling <br>
A lot of spirits gotta break <br>
To make the underworld go ‘round <br>
 <br>
FATES & COMPANY <br>
Way down Hadestown <br>
Way down under the ground! <br>
 <br>

## Flowers  

 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
What I wanted was to fall asleep <br>
Close my eyes and disappear <br>
Like a petal on a stream, a feather on the air <br>
Lily white and poppy red <br>
I trembled when he laid me out <br>
You won’t feel a thing, he said, when you go down <br>
Nothing gonna wake you now <br>
Dreams are sweet until they’re not <br>
Men are kind until they aren’t <br>
Flowers bloom until they rot and fall apart <br>
Is anybody listening? <br>
I open my mouth and nothing comes out <br>
Nothing <br>
Nothing gonna wake me now <br>
Flowers, I remember fields <br>
Of flowers, soft beneath my heels <br>
Walking in the sun <br>
I remember someone <br>
Someone by my side <br>
Turned his face to mine <br>
And then I turned away <br>
Into the shade <br>
You, the one I left behind <br>
If you ever walk this way <br>
Come and find me lying in the bed I made <br>
 <br>

## Come Home With Me II 

 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Come home with me! <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
It’s you! <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
It’s me. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
Orpheus! <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Eurydice. Please, come home. <br>
I’m not going back alone. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
But how’d you get here? On the train? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Nah, I walked. <br>
I walked and sang. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
But how’d you get beyond the wall? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
I sang a song so beautiful the stones wept and they let me in. <br>
And I can sing us home again. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
No, you can’t. <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Yes I can. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
Are you always this confident? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
When I look at you I am. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
When you look at me, what do you see? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
I see someone stronger than me, <br>
I see somebody who survives. <br>
... I see my wife. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
Why are you getting on your knees? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
I’m asking you to marry me. Marry me. Say “I do”. <br>
I came all this way to ask you to. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
Orpheus... <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Eurydice. <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
The two of us, you and me. <br>
That is how it would have been, if the world was different. <br>
But have you seen the world? <br>
It isn’t beautiful! It doesn’t change for me and you, <br>
No matter how much we want it to! <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
Can’t you see she made a deal? <br>
Gave her word, took a vow <br>
See, it’s all been signed and sealed <br>
She belongs to Hades now <br>
She belongs to him <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
That isn’t true. <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
She belongs to him <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
It isn’t true. <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
She belongs to him <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
Say it isn’t true! <br>
 <br>
FATES <br>
She belongs to him <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE (spoken) <br>
I do. <br>
 <br>
 <br>

## Papers 

 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
Young man! <br>
I don't think we've met before. <br>
You're not from around here, son. <br>
Don't know who the hell you are but I can tell you don't belong. <br>
These are working people, son! Law-abiding citizens. <br>
Go back to where you came from. <br>
You're on the wrong side of the fence. <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
See, Orpheus was a poor boy. <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
You hear me, son? <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
And Hades was a mighty king. <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
You better run! <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
But this poor boy raised up his voice, even though it was trembling. <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS (spoken) <br>
I'm not going back alone. I came to take her home. <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken & laughs) <br>
Who the hell do you think you are? <br>
Who the hell do you think you're talking to? <br>
She couldn't go anywhere, even if she wanted to. <br>
You're not from around here, son. If you were, <br>
Then you would know that everyone and everything in Hadestown, I own. <br>
As for you... <br>
Everybody, gather around! <br>
Everyone, come look and see what becomes of trespassers with no respect for property! <br>
 <br>

## Nothing Changes 

 <br>
FATES <br>
Why the struggle, why the strain? <br>
Why make trouble? Why make scenes? <br>
Why go against the grain? <br>
Why swim upstream? <br>
It ain’t <br>
It ain’t <br>
It ain’t no use <br>
You’re bound <br>
You’re bound <br>
You’re bound to lose <br>
What’s done <br>
What’s done <br>
What’s done is done <br>
That’s the way the river runs <br>
So why get wet? Why break a sweat? <br>
Why waste your precious breath? <br>
Why beat your handsome brow? <br>
Nothing changes <br>
Nothing changes <br>
Nothing changes anyhow <br>
 <br>

## If It's True  

 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
If it’s true what they say <br>
If my love is gone for good <br>
They can take this heart away <br>
They can take this flesh and blood <br>
Take my mouth that kissed her mouth <br>
Take my tongue that sung her praise <br>
Take my arms that used to reach out <br>
In the dark where she lay <br>
If it’s true what they say <br>
I’ll be on my way <br>
If it’s true what they say <br>
If there’s nothing to be done <br>
If there’s no part to be played <br>
If there’s no song to be sung <br>
Take this voice, take these hands <br>
I can’t use them anyway <br>
Take this music and the memory <br>
Of the muse from which it came <br>
If it’s true what they say <br>
I’ll be on my way <br>
We can all be on our way <br>
If it’s true what they say <br>
 <br>
But the ones who tell the lies <br>
Are the solemnest to swear <br>
And the ones who load the dice <br>
Always say the toss is fair <br>
And the ones who deal the cards <br>
Are the ones who take the tricks <br>
With their hands over their hearts <br>
While we play the game they fix <br>
And the ones who speak the words <br>
Always say it is the last <br>
And no answer will be heard <br>
To the question no one asks <br>
So I ask you as a brother <br>
And I ask you as a friend <br>
And I ask you as a lover <br>
And I ask you once again <br>
Is it true what they say? <br>
 <br>

## How Long 

 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Hades, my husband, Hades, my light <br>
Hades, my darkness <br>
If you had heard how he sang tonight <br>
You’d pity poor Orpheus! <br>
All of his sorrow won’t fit in his chest <br>
It just burns like a fire in the pit of his chest <br>
And his heart is a bird on a spit in his chest <br>
How long, how long, how long? <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
How long? Just as long as Hades is King <br>
Nothing comes of wishing on stars <br>
And nothing comes of the songs people sing <br>
However sorry they are <br>
Give them a piece and they’ll take it all <br>
Show them the crack and they’ll tear down the wall <br>
Lend them an ear and the Kingdom will fall <br>
The Kingdom will fall for a song <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
What does he care for the logic of kings? <br>
The laws of your underworld? <br>
It is only for love that he sings! <br>
He sings for the love of a girl <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
You and your pity don’t fit in my bed <br>
You just burn like a fire in the pit of my bed <br>
And I turn like a bird on a spit in my bed <br>
How long, how long, how long? <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
How long? Just as long as I am your wife <br>
It’s true the earth must die <br>
But then the earth comes back to life <br>
And the sun just goes on rising <br>
 <br>
HADES & PERSEPHONE <br>
And how does the sun even fit in the sky? <br>
It just burns like a fire in the pit of the sky <br>
And the earth is a bird on a spit in the sky <br>
How long, how long, how long? <br>
 <br>

## Chant II 

 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
Now everybody knows the walls have ears <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
And the walls had heard what the boy was saying <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
A million tons of stone and steel... <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Is it true? <br>
 <br>
HERMES <br>
Echoed his refrain. <br>
 <br>
HADES (laughs) <br>
When I was a young man like you <br>
Son, I held a woman too <br>
Held her in my naked hands <br>
When I was a young man <br>
Now you know how it feels <br>
Women are as slick as eels <br>
Woman, quicker than the asp <br>
Always slipping from your grasp <br>
 <br>
Take it from a man no longer young <br>
If you want to hold a woman, son <br>
Hang a chain around her throat <br>
Made of many carat gold <br>
Shackle her from wrist to wrist <br>
With sterling silver bracelets <br>
Fill her pockets full of stones <br>
Precious ones, diamonds, <br>
Bind her with a golden band <br>
Take it from an old man <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Low, keep your head, keep your head low <br>
Oh, you gotta keep your head low <br>
If you wanna keep your head <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS & EURYDICE <br>
La la la la la la la... <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Oh, he said he’d shelter us <br>
He said he’d harbor me <br>
He said we'd build them up <br>
And then the walls would set us free <br>
I’m gonna count to three <br>
And then I’ll raise my head singing, <br>
One, two, is it true? <br>
Is it true, what he said? <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
When I was a young girl like you <br>
Sister, I was hungry too <br>
Hungry for the underworld <br>
When I was a young girl <br>
Now you know how it tastes <br>
The fruit of Mr. Hades’ ways <br>
Sister, it’s a bitter wine-- <br>
Spit it out while you still have time <br>
 <br>
Take it from a woman of my age <br>
Love is not a gilded cage <br>
All the wealth within these walls <br>
Will never buy the thing called love <br>
 <br>
Love was when he came to me <br>
Begging on his bended knees <br>
To please have pity on his heart <br>
And let him lay me in the dirt... <br>
 <br>
I felt his arms around me then <br>
We didn’t need a wedding bed <br>
Dark seeds scattered on the ground <br>
The wild birds were flying around <br>
 <br>
That’s when I became his wife <br>
But that was in another life <br>
That was in another world <br>
When I was a young girl! <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS & EURYDICE <br>
La la la la la la la... <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Low, keep your head, keep your head low <br>
Oh, you gotta keep your head low <br>
If you wanna keep your head <br>
 <br>
Oh, he said he’d shelter us <br>
He said he’d harbor me <br>
He said we’d soldier on <br>
And then the war would bring us peace <br>
We’re gonna count to three <br>
And then we'll raise our heads, singing <br>
One, two, is it true? <br>
Is it true, what he said? <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
Young man, I was young once too <br>
I once sang the young man’s blues <br>
Women come and women go <br>
Get you high and get you low <br>
One day she’s hot, the next she’s cold <br>
Women are so seasonal <br>
Women leave again and again <br>
Take it from an old man <br>
 <br>
Now I sing a different song <br>
One I can depend upon <br>
The simple tune, the steady beat <br>
The music of machinery <br>
Do you hear that heavy metal sound? <br>
The symphony of Hadestown <br>
And in this symphony of mine <br>
Of power chords and power lines <br>
Young man, you can strum your lyre, <br>
I have strung the world in wire <br>
Young man, you can sing your ditty <br>
I CONDUCT THE ELECTRIC CITY! <br>
 <br>
I’ll tell you what, young man <br>
Since my wife is such a fan, <br>
And since I’m going to count to three, <br>
And put you out of your misery <br>
One!-- give me one more song <br>
One more song before I send you <br>
Two!-- to the great beyond <br>
Where nobody can hear you singing <br>
Three!-- sing a song for me <br>
Make me laugh, make me weep <br>
Make the king feel young again <br>
Sing for an old man! <br>
 <br>

## Epic (Part III) 

 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Heavy and hard is the heart of the king <br>
King of iron, king of steel <br>
The heart of the king loves everything <br>
Like the hammer loves the nail <br>
 <br>
But the heart of a man is a simple one <br>
Small and soft, flesh and blood <br>
And all that it loves is a woman <br>
A woman is all that it loves <br>
 <br>
And Hades is King of the scythe and the sword <br>
He covers the world in the color of rust <br>
He scrapes the sky and scars the earth <br>
And he comes down heavy and hard on us <br>
 <br>
But even that hardest of hearts unhardened <br>
Suddenly, when he saw her there <br>
Persephone in her mother’s garden <br>
Sun on her shoulders, wind in her hair <br>
 <br>
The smell of the flowers she held in her hand <br>
And the pollen that fell from her fingertips <br>
And suddenly Hades was only a man <br>
With a taste of nectar upon his lips, singing: <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
And what has become of the heart of that man, <br>
Now that the man is King? <br>
What has become of the heart of that man, <br>
Now that he has everything? <br>
 <br>
The more he has, the more he holds, <br>
The greater the weight of the world on his shoulders <br>
See how he labors beneath that load <br>
Afraid to look up, and afraid to let go <br>
And he keeps his head low, and he keeps his back bending <br>
He grows so afraid that he'll lose what he owns <br>
But what he doesn't know is that what he's defending <br>
Is already gone <br>
 <br>
Where is the treasure inside your chest? <br>
Where is your pleasure? Where is your youth? <br>
Where is the man with his hat in his hands? <br>
Who stands in the garden with nothing to lose, singing: <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
HADES <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>
 <br>
BOTH <br>
La la la la la la la… <br>

## Word to the Wise  

 <br>
FATES <br>
Gotta think quick <br>
Gotta save face <br>
Caught between a rock and a hard place <br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do <br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do now? <br>
 <br>
If you tell him no, <br>
Oh, you’re a heartless man <br>
And you’re gonna have a martyr on your hands <br>
If you let him go, <br>
Oh, you’re a spineless king <br>
And you’re never gonna get them in line again <br>
 <br>
Damned if you don’t <br>
Damned if you do <br>
Whole damn nation’s watching you <br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, <br>
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do now? <br>
 <br>
Here’s a little tip <br>
Word to the wise <br>
Here’s a little snippet of advice: <br>
Men are fools <br>
Men are frail <br>
Give them the rope and they’ll hang themselves <br>
 <br>

## His Kiss, The Riot  

 <br>
HADES <br>
The devil take this Orpheus <br>
And his belladonna kiss <br>
Beautiful and poisonous <br>
Lovely! Deadly! <br>
 <br>
Now it thickens on my tongue <br>
Now it quickens in my lung <br>
Now I’m stricken! Now I’m stung! <br>
It’s done already! <br>
 <br>
Dangerous this jack of hearts <br>
With his kiss the riot starts <br>
 <br>
All my children came here poor <br>
Clamoring for bed and board <br>
Now what do they clamor for? <br>
Freedom! Freedom! <br>
 <br>
Have I made myself their Lord <br>
Just to fall upon the sword <br>
Of some pauper’s minor chord? <br>
Who will lead them? <br>
 <br>
Who lays all the best laid plans? <br>
Who makes work for idle hands? <br>
 <br>
Only one thing to be done <br>
Let them think that they have won <br>
Let them leave together <br>
Under one condition <br>
Orpheus, the undersigned <br>
Shall not turn to look behind <br>
She’s out of sight! <br>
And he’s out of his mind! <br>
 <br>
Every coward seems courageous <br>
In the safety of the crowd <br>
Bravery can be contagious <br>
When the band is playing loud <br>
Nothing makes a man so bold <br>
As a woman’s smile and a hand to hold <br>
But all alone his blood runs thin <br>
And doubt comes, doubt comes in <br>
 <br>

## Promises 

 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Promises you made to me <br>
You said the rivers and the trees <br>
Would fill our pockets and our plates <br>
Promises you made <br>
You said the birds would blanket us <br>
You said the world was generous <br>
And wouldn’t turn its back on us <br>
 <br>
The river froze, the trees were bare <br>
And all the birds, they disappeared <br>
So me too, I flew away <br>
From promises you made <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Promises you made to me <br>
You said that you would stay with me <br>
Whatever weather came our way <br>
Promises you made <br>
That we would walk, side by side <br>
Through all the seasons of our lives <br>
'Neath any sky, down any road <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>
 <br>
I have no ring for your finger <br>
I have no banquet table laid <br>
I have no bed of feathers <br>
Whatever promises I’ve made <br>
Can’t promise you fair sky above <br>
Can’t promise you kind road below <br>
But I’ll walk with you, my love <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
I don’t need gold, don’t need silver <br>
Just bread when I’m hungry, fire when I’m cold <br>
Don’t need a ring for my finger <br>
Just need a steady hand to hold <br>
Don’t promise me fair sky above <br>
Don’t promise me kind road below <br>
Just walk with me, my love <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
I don’t know where this road will end <br>
But I’ll walk with you into the wind <br>
 <br>
BOTH <br>
I can’t promise you fair sky above <br>
Can’t promise you kind road below <br>
But I’ll walk with you, my love <br>
Any way the wind blows <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
Do you let me walk with you? <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
I do <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
I do <br>
 <br>
BOTH <br>
I do <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
And keep on walking, come what will? <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS <br>
I will <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
I will <br>
 <br>
BOTH <br>
We will <br>
 <br>

## Wait For Me II 

 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
Meanest dog you’ll ever meet - <br>
It ain’t the hound dog in the street. <br>
He bares his teeth and tears your skin <br>
But brother, that’s the worst of him. <br>
The dog you really got to dread <br>
Is the one that howls inside your head. <br>
It's him whose howling drives men mad <br>
And a mind to its undoing. <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE (spoken) <br>
You think they’ll make it? <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
I don’t know. <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE (spoken) <br>
Hades, you let them go. <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
I let them try. <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE (spoken) <br>
Then how ‘bout you and I? <br>
Are we gonna try again? <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
It’s almost spring. <br>
We’ll try again next fall. <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE (spoken) <br>
Wait for me? <br>
 <br>
HADES (spoken) <br>
I will. <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming <br>
Wait, I’m coming with you <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming too <br>
I’m coming too <br>
 <br>
HERMES (spoken) <br>
You got a lonesome road to walk. <br>
It ain’t along the railroad track. <br>
It ain’t along the black-top tar <br>
You’ve walked a hundred times before. <br>
I’ll tell you where the real road lies: <br>
Between your ears, behind your eyes. <br>
That is the path to Paradise, <br>
And, likewise, the road to ruin. <br>
 <br>
COMPANY <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming <br>
Wait, I’m coming with you <br>
Wait for me, I’m coming too <br>
I’m coming too <br>
Wait, wait- <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Wait. <br>
Wait... <br>
 <br>
 <br>

## Doubt Comes In 

 <br>
ORPHEUS & FATES <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
And strips the paint <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
And turns the wine <br>
Doubt comes in and leaves a trace <br>
Of vinegar and turpentine <br>
Where are you? Where are you now? <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
And kills the lights <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
And chills the air <br>
Doubt comes in and all falls silent <br>
It’s as though you aren’t there <br>
Where are you? Where are you now? <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Orpheus <br>
You’re shivering <br>
Is it cold or fear? <br>
Just keep singing <br>
The coldest night <br>
Of the coldest year <br>
Comes right before the spring <br>
 <br>
ORPHEUS & FATES <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
With tricky fingers <br>
Doubt comes in <br>
With fickle tongues <br>
Doubt comes in and my heart falters <br>
And forgets the songs it sung <br>
Where are you? Where are you now? <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Orpheus <br>
Hold on <br>
Hold on tight <br>
It won’t be long <br>
’cause the darkest hour <br>
Of the darkest night <br>
Comes right before the dawn <br>
 <br>
 <br>

## Road to Hell II 

 <br>
HERMES (mumbles and sighs) <br>
Alright, alright <br>
It’s an old song <br>
It’s an old tale from way back when <br>
It’s an old song <br>
And we’re gonna sing it again and again <br>
 <br>
We’re gonna sing it again <br>
 <br>
There was a railroad line on a road to Hell <br>
There was a young man down on bended knee <br>
And that is the ending of the tale <br>
Of Orpheus and Eurydice <br>
 <br>
It’s a sad song <br>
It’s a sad tale, it’s a tragedy <br>
It’s a sad song <br>
But we sing it anyway <br>
 <br>
(sighs and spoken) <br>
Cause, here’s the thing <br>
To know how it ends <br>
And still begin to sing it again <br>
As if it might turn out this time <br>
I learned that from a friend of mine <br>
 <br>
See, Orpheus was a poor boy <br>
But he had a gift to give: <br>
He could make you see how the world could be, <br>
In spite of the way that it is <br>
 <br>
Can you see it? <br>
Can you hear it? <br>
Can you feel it like a train? <br>
Is it coming? <br>
Is it coming this a-way? <br>
 <br>
(sung) <br>
On a sunny day there was a railroad car <br>
And a lady stepping off a train <br>
Everybody looked and everybody saw <br>
That spring had come again <br>
 <br>
With a love song <br>
With a tale of a love that never dies <br>
With a love song <br>
For anyone who tries. <br>
 <br>

## I Raise My Cup 

 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Pour the wine and raise a cup <br>
Drink up, brothers, you know how <br>
And spill a drop for Orpheus <br>
Wherever he is now <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
Some birds sing when the sun shines bright <br>
My praise is not for them <br>
But the one who sings in the dead of night <br>
I raise my cup to him <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
Wherever he is wandering <br>
Alone upon the earth <br>
Let all our singing follow him <br>
And bring him comfort <br>
Some flowers bloom when the green grass grows <br>
My praise is not for them <br>
But the one who blooms in the bitter snow <br>
I raise my cup to him <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
I raise my cup and drink it up <br>
 <br>
EURYDICE <br>
I raise it high and drink it dry <br>
 <br>
PERSEPHONE <br>
To Orpheus and all of us <br>
Goodnight, brothers, goodnight <br>
 <br>
