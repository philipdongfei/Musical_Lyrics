# HADESTOWN

## SYNOPSIS

Act I

As in the 2010 album, Hadestown adapts the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice to a Great Depression-era inspired post-apocalyptic setting. The musical opens with the three Fates describing the setting ("Any Way the Wind Blows"), after which Hermes, the narrator, enters to introduce each of the characters ("Road to Hell"). The stage empties, leaving only Orpheus and Eurydice. The two introduce themselves to each other, and Orpheus asks Eurydice to marry him ("Come Home With Me"). Eurydice is doubtful, since they both live in poverty and she wants a life of stability. Orpheus persuades her by telling her that his music will provide for them ("Wedding Song").

After an interlude in which Orpheus tells the story of Hades and Persephone ("Epic (Part I)"), Persephone enters to celebrate the summertime with Orpheus and Eurydice ("Living It Up On Top"). Orpheus makes a toast to Persephone and expresses hope for his future with Eurydice, who reflects on her growing love for Orpheus despite her independence ("All I've Ever Known"). The two promise to stay with each other no matter what hardships they face.

Winter comes, and along with it a train to bring Persephone back to Hadestown – Hades' underground factory. Orpheus and Eurydice watch as Persephone voices her misery at having to return to the factory, while the Fates appear to praise Hadestown's riches. Orpheus condemns Hades' treatment of his workers, but Eurydice is intrigued ("Way Down Hadestown"). As winter progresses, Orpheus continues to write music while Eurydice urges him to work so they can have food and shelter. At the same time, Hades and Persephone fight about the decline of their own relationship ("Epic (Part II)/Chant").

Hades leaves the factory to find someone who will appreciate the safety and comfort of Hadestown. He comes across Eurydice and asks her to join him in Hadestown ("Hey Little Songbird"). The Fates arrive, and urge Eurydice to put her survival first ("When the Chips are Down"). With Orpheus away working on his music, Eurydice decides to follow Hades to the factory ("Gone, I'm Gone"). When Orpheus returns to look for Eurydice, Hermes tells him that she's gone to Hadestown and tells Orpheus how to get there without using Hades' train ("Wait For Me"). Eurydice arrives at Hadestown, and begins her work on the wall surrounding it ("Why We Build the Wall").


Act II

Following an entr'acte where Persephone introduces herself and the band, and serves drinks to the audience ("Our Lady Of The Underground"), we see Eurydice realizing the true consequences of her choice to come to Hadestown: she can never leave unless Hades chooses to let her go ("Way Down Hadestown II"). After signing her contract with Hades, she sings of her regrets with allusions to a sexual assault ("Flowers").

Orpheus, having made his way to Hadestown following Hermes' directions, finds Eurydice and begs her to come home and marry him. Eurydice and the Fates tell Orpheus that she legally belongs to Hades and can't return without his permission ("Come Home With Me II"). Hades arrives, and Orpheus confronts him. Hades asserts that he does own Eurydice, and attempts to chase Orpheus off his property ("Papers"). The Fates surround an exhausted Orpheus and tell him to give up on saving Eurydice ("Nothing Changes"). Orpheus sings of his despair at losing Eurydice, which Persephone overhears ("If It's True"). Touched by Orpheus' music, Persephone tells Hades to let Eurydice go ("How Long"). Hades offers to give Orpheus a chance to sing for him ("Chant II"). Orpheus sings a version of the song he'd been writing when Eurydice left, reminding Hades of his love for Persephone ("Epic (Part III)"). Hades is affected more than he had expected, and the Fates explain his dilemma: if he keeps Eurydice captive, she becomes a martyr, but if he lets her go, then he loses his authoritarian control over the factory ("Word to the Wise"). He decides to leave their fate in Orpheus' hands: the couple can leave together, but Orpheus has to lead them out. If he turns to see if Eurydice is following him, she will belong to Hades forever ("His Kiss, The Riot").

Hermes explains Hades' decision to Orpheus and Eurydice, who discuss all of their doubts with the hope of being able to trust one another on their way out ("Promises"). Orpheus begins the walk out of Hadestown with Eurydice following him, guided in part by the Fates ("Wait for Me II"). Orpheus makes it right up until the very end of the journey, when he is overcome with doubt and turns to look for Eurydice – only to see that she's been right behind him all along, thus condemning her to stay in Hadestown forever ("Doubt Comes In"). Hermes leads Eurydice back to Hadestown ("Road to Hell II"), and the show closes with Persephone raising a toast to Orpheus ("I Raise My Cup").

Synopsis to Hadestown musical

## Any Way the Wind Blows

FATES
In the fever of a world in flames
In the season of the hurricanes
Flood will get you if the fire don’t
Any way the wind blows

And there ain’t a thing that you can do
When the weather takes a turn on you
‘Cept for hurry up and hit the road
Any way the wind blows

Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south
Ain’t nobody gonna stick around
When the dark clouds roll
Any way the wind blows

In the valley of the exodus
In the belly of a bowl of dust
Crows and buzzards flying low
Any way the wind blows

No use talking of the past, it’s passed
Set out walking and you don’t look back
Where you’re goin’ there ain’t no one knows
Any way the wind blows

Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south
Gone the same way as the shantytown
And the traveling show
Any way the wind blows

## Road to Hell

HERMES
Once upon a time there was a railroad line
Don’t ask where, brother, don’t ask when
It was a road to Hell—No! It was hard times
It was a world of gods and men

HERMES & COMPANY
It’s an old song
It’s an old tale from way back when
It’s an old song
But we’re gonna sing it again

HERMES
Now on the road to Hell there was a railroad line
And there were three old women all dressed the same
And they was always singin’ in the back of your mind
Everybody meet the Fates!

Now on the road to Hell there was a railroad station
And a man with feathers on his feet
Who would help you to your final destination
Mr. Hermes - that’s me!

HERMES & COMPANY
It’s a sad song
It’s a sad tale, it’s a tragedy
It’s a sad song
But we sing it anyway

HERMES
Now, on the road to Hell there was a railroad line
And a lady steppin' off a train
With a suitcase full of summertime
Persephone, by name

There was a railroad line on the road to Hell
There was a young man down on a bended knee
And brother, thus begins the tale
Of Orpheus and Eurydice!

HERMES & COMPANY
It’s a love song
It’s a tale of a love that never dies
It’s a love song
About someone who tries

EURYDICE (spoken)
A singer! Is that what you are?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Well, I also play the lyre.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Oh, a liar! And a player too?
I’ve met too many men like you.

ORPHEUS (spoken)
I’m not like any man you’ve met.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Oh yeah? What makes you different?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
You see the world?

EURYDICE (spoken)
Of course I do.

I’m sure you play it well,
But only the gods can change the world.
Me and you can’t change a thing.

ORPHEUS (spoken)
You haven’t heard me sing.

EURYDICE (laughs and spoken)
Are you always this confident?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
When I look at you I am.

EURYDICE (spoken)
When you look at me, what do you see?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Someone stronger than me, somebody who survives.

EURYDICE (spoken)
So why should I become your wife?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Because I make you feel alive.

EURYDICE (spoken)
That’s worth a lot... What else you got?


## Wedding Song

EURYDICE
Lover tell me if you can
Who’s gonna buy the wedding bands?
Times being what they are
Hard, and getting harder all the time

ORPHEUS
Lover when I sing my song
All the rivers sing along
And they’re gonna break their banks for me
To lay their gold around my feet
All a-flashing in the pan
All to fashion for your hand
The rivers are gonna give us the wedding band

EURYDICE
Lover tell me if you’re able
Who’s gonna lay the wedding table
Times being what they are
Dark, and getting darker all the time

ORPHEUS
Lover when I sing my song
All the trees are gonna sing along
And bend their branches down to me
To lay their fruit around my feet
The almond and the apple
And the sugar from the maple
The trees gonna lay the wedding table

EURYDICE
Lover tell me, when we’ll wed
Who’s gonna make the wedding bed?
Times being what they are
Hard, and getting harder all the time

ORPHEUS
Lover when I sing my song
All the birds gonna sing along
And they’ll come flying round to me
To lay their feathers at my feet
And we’ll lie down in eiderdown
A pillow ’neath our heads
The birds are gonna make the wedding bed
And the trees are gonna lay the wedding table
And the rivers are gonna give us the wedding band

## Epic 1 

ORPHEUS
King of diamonds, king of spades
Hades was king of the kingdom of dirt
Miners of mines, diggers of graves
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work
And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat
Who paid them their wages and set them about
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths
Of the earth to turn its insides out, singing
La la la la la la la…

King of mortar, king of bricks
The River Styx was a river of stones
And Hades laid them high and thick
With a million hands that were not his own
And a million feet that fell in line
And stepped in time with Hades’ step
And a million minds that were just one mind
Like stones in a row
Stone by stone
Row by row
The river rose up, singing
La la la la la la la…

PERSEPHONE (spoken)
You think I give a damn?

PERSEPHONE
Let the poet bless this round!

ORPHEUS (spoken)
To the patroness of all of this: Persephone!

HERMES (spoken)
Here, here!

ORPHEUS
To the sunshine and the fruit of the vine
She gives us every year
Asking nothing in return, except that we should live
And learn to live as brothers in this life
And to trust she will provide
If no one takes too much, there will always be enough
She will always fill our cups
And we will always raise them up!
(raises his cup & spoken)
Let the world we dream about be the one we live in now!
(takes a drink)
‘Cause right now we’re livin' it-

COMPANY

## All I've Ever Know

[Eurydice]:
I was alone so long
Didn't even know that I was lonely

Out in the cold so long
Didn't even know that I was cold
Turn my collar to the wind
This is how it's always been

All I've ever known is how to hold my own

All I've ever known is how to hold my own
but now I want to hold you too


You take me in your arms
And suddenly there's sunlight all around
Everything bright and warm
Shining like it never did before
And for a moment I forget
Just how dark and cold it gets

All I've ever known is how to hold my own

All I've ever known is how to hold my own
but now I want to hold you
Hold you close, I don't want to ever have to let you go
Now I want to hold you, hold you tight
I don't want to go back to the moonlight

Say that you'll hold me forever
Say that the wind won't change on us
Say that we'll stay with each other
That it will always be like this

[Orpheus]:
I want to hold you forever
The wind will never change on us
As long as we stay with each other
It will always be like this

## Way Down Hadestown

HERMES
Follow that dollar for a long way down
Far away from the poorhouse door
Either get to hell or to Hadestown
Ain’t no difference anymore
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground
Hound dog howl and the whistle blow
Train comes a-rollin, clickety-clack
Nobody knows where that old train goes
Those who go they don’t come back
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

PERSEPHONE
Winter’s nigh and summer’s o’er
I hear that high and lonesome sound
Of my husband coming for
To bring me home to Hadestown
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

EURYDICE
Everybody dresses in clothes so fine
Everybody’s pockets are weighted down
Everybody sipping ambrosia wine
In a goldmine in Hadestown
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

ORPHEUS
Everybody hungry, everybody tired
Everybody slaves by the sweat of his brow
The wage is nothing and the work is hard
It’s a graveyard in Hadestown
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

FATES
Every little penny in the wishing well
Every little nickel on the drum
All them shiny little heads and tails
Where do you think they come from?
They come from way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

ORPHEUS & HERMES
Mister Hades is a mean old boss
With a silver whistle and a golden scale
An eye for an eye!
And he weighs the cost
A lie for a lie!
And your soul for sale
Sold!
To the king on the chromium throne
Thrown!
To the bottom of a sing-sing cell
Where the little wheel squeal and the big wheel groan
And you better forget about your wishing well
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground

EURYDICE
Mr. Hades is a mighty king
Must be making some mighty big deals
Seems like he owns everything
Kind of makes you wonder how it feels
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground
Way down under the ground
Way down under the ground

## Epct 2

ORPHEUS
Heavy and hard is the heart of the king
King of iron, king of steel
The heart of the king loves everything
Like the hammer loves the nail

But the heart of a man is a simple one
Small and soft, flesh and blood
And all that it loves is a woman
A woman is all that it loves

And Hades is king of the scythe and the sword
He covers the world in the color of rust
He scrapes the sky and scars the earth
And he comes down heavy and hard on us

But even that hardest of hearts unhardened
Suddenly, when he saw her there
Persephone in her mother’s garden
Sun on her shoulders, wind in her hair

The smell of the flowers she held in her hand
And the pollen that fell from her fingertips
And suddenly Hades was only a man
With a taste of nectar upon his lips, singing:
La la la la la la la…

## Epic (Part II) / Chant

ORPHEUS
King of diamonds, king of spades
Hades was king of a kingdom of dirt
Miners of mines, diggers of graves
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work

And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat
Who paid them their wages and set them about
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths of the earth
To turn its insides out, singing:
La la la la la la la…

King of mortar, kings of bricks
The river Styx was a river of stones
And Hades laid them high and thick
With a million hands that were not his own

And a million feet that fell in line
That stepped in time with Hades’ step
And a million minds that were just one mind
Like stones in a row,
And stone by stone,
Row by row,
The river rose up, singing:
La la la la la la la…

## Hey Little Songbird

HADES
Hey, little songbird, give me a song
I’m a busy man and I can’t stay long
I got clients to call, I got orders to fill
I got walls to build, I got riots to quell
And they’re giving me hell back in Hades
Hey, little songbird, cat got your tongue?
Always a pity for one so pretty and young
When poverty comes to clip your wings
And knock the wind right out of your lungs
Hey, nobody sings on empty

EURYDICE
Strange is the call of this strange man
I want to fly down and feed at his hand
I want a nice soft place to land
I wanna lie down forever

HADES
Hey, little songbird, you got something fine
You’d shine like a diamond down in the mine
And the choice is yours if you’re willing to choose
Seeing as you’ve got nothing to lose
And I could use a canary

EURYDICE
Suddenly nothing is as it was
Where are you now, Orpheus?
Wasn’t it always the two of us
Weren’t we birds of a feather?

HADES
Hey, little songbird, let me guess
He’s some kind of poet and he’s penniless
Give him your hand, he’ll give you his hand-to-mouth
He’ll write you a poem when the power’s out
Hey, why not fly south for the winter?
Hey, little songbird, look all around you
See how the vipers and vultures surround you
They’ll take you down, they’ll pick you clean
If you stick around such a desperate scene
See people get mean when the chips are down

## When the Chips are Down

FATES
Life ain’t easy, life ain’t fair
A girl’s gotta fight for a rightful share
What you gonna do when the chips are down
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down
Now that the chips are down
Help yourself, to hell with the rest
Even the one who loves you best
What you gonna do when the chips are down
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down
Now that the chips are down

EURYDICE
Oh my aching heart

FATES
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down
Take if you can, give if you must
Ain’t nobody but yourself to trust
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down
Aim for the heart, shoot to kill
If you don’t do it then the other one will
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down
And the first shall be first
And the last shall be last
Cast your eyes to heaven
You get a knife in the back
Nobody’s righteous
Nobody’s proud
Nobody’s innocent
Now that the chips are down
Now that the
Now that the
Now that the
Now that the
Now that the chips are down


## Gone, I'm Gone

EURYDICE
Orpheus, my heart is yours
Always was and will be
It’s my gut I can’t ignore
Orpheus, I’m hungry
Oh, my heart, it aches to stay
But the flesh will have its way
Oh, the way is dark and long
I’m already gone, I’m gone

FATES
Go ahead and lay the blame
Talk of virtue, talk of sin
Wouldn’t you have done the same?
In her shoes, in her skin
You can have your principles
When you’ve got a bellyful
But hunger has a way with you
There’s no telling what you’re gonna do
When the chips are down
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are down


## Wait For Me

HERMES
How to get to Hadestown
You’ll have to take the long way down
Through the underground, under cover of night
Laying low, staying out of sight
Ain’t no compass, brother, there ain’t no map
Just a telephone wire and the railroad track
Keep on walking and you don’t look back
’Til you get to the bottomland

ORPHEUS
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too

HERMES
River Styx is high and wide
Cinderbricks and razorwire
Walls of iron and concrete
Hound dogs howling round the gate
Them dogs’ll lay down and play dead
If you got the bones, if you got the bread
But if all you got is your own two legs
You best be glad you got ’em

ORPHEUS
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too

HERMES
You’re on the lam, you’re on the run
Don’t give your name, you don’t have one
And don’t look no one in the eye
That town will try to suck you dry
They’ll suck your brain, they’ll suck your breath
They’ll pluck the heart right out your chest
They’ll truss you up in your Sunday best
And stuff your mouth with cotton

OPHEUS
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming
Wait, wait, wait, wait

## Our Lady of the Underground

PERSEPHONE
I don’t know about you, boys
But if you’re like me, then hanging around
This old manhole is bringing you down
Six-feet-under getting under your skin
Cabin fever is a-setting in
You’re stir crazy! You’re stuck in a rut!
Or you could use a little pick-me-up
I can give you what it is you crave
A little something from the good old days
I got the wind right here in a jar
I got the rain on tap at the bar
I got sunshine up on the shelf
Allow me to introduce myself

Brother, what’s my name?
My name is…

CROWD
Our Lady of the Underground!

PERSEPHONE
Brother, what’s my name?

CROWD
Our Lady of Ways!
Our Lady of Means!

PERSEPHONE
Brother, what’s my name?
My name is…

CROWD
Our Lady of the Upside Down

PERSEPHONE
Brother what’s my name?
I’ll tell you my name…
Persephone!

Come here, brother, let me guess
It’s the little things you miss
Spring flowers, autumn leaves
Ask me, brother, and you shall receive
Or maybe these just ain’t enough
Maybe you’re looking for some stronger stuff
I got a sight for the sorest eye
When’s the last time you saw the sky?
Wipe away your tears, brother
Brother, I know how you feel
I can see you’re blinded by the sadness of it all
But look a little closer, everything will be revealed
Look a little closer, there’s a crack in the wall

You want stars? I got a skyful
Put a quarter in the slot, you’ll get an eyeful
You want the moon? I got her too
She’s right here waiting in my pay-per-view
Oh, how long’s it been?
A little moonshine ain’t no sin
One at a time, boys, straight line
What the boss don’t know, the boss won’t mind

## Way Down Hadestown II

HERMES
Now in Hadestown there was a lot of souls

COMPANY
Low, keep your head, keep your head

HERMES
Working on the wall with all their might

COMPANY
Oh, you gotta keep your head

HERMES
You see, they kept their heads down low

COMPANY
If you wanna keep your head

HERMES
You couldn’t quite see their faces right
Oh, but you could hear them singing:

COMPANY
Low, keep your head, keep your head

HERMES
Swinging their hammers in the cold, hard ground
You could hear the sound of the pickaxe a-ringing

COMPANY
One! Two! If you wanna keep your head

HERMES & COMPANY
They called it “freedom”

EURYDICE (spoken)
I’m free! We’re free!
Mr. Hades set us free!

FATES
Mr. Hades set you free
To work yourself into the ground
Free to spend eternity
In the factory
And the warehouse
Where the whistles scream
And the foreman shouts
And you’re punchin' in
And punchin' in
And punchin' in
And you can’t punch out!

FATES (COMPANY)
You're way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head)
Way down under the ground!

EURYDICE (spoken)
But I don’t understand... you said this was the promised land!

FATES
You sell your soul,
You get your due!
That is all we promised you!

Heard that mighty trumpet sound,
Crossed the river to the Other Side,
Thought you’d lay your burdens down
And rest in peace in Paradise
But there ain’t no rest for your weary soul
Hades keeps you toiling

HADES & FATES
Shoveling coal in a big black hole to keep his boiler boiling

FATES (COMPANY)
Way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head)
Way down under the ground!

EURYDICE (spoken)
But don’t you see?
It’s different with me!

FATES (spoken)
Different than who? They thought they were different too!
(sings)
Down in the river of oblivion
You kissed your little life goodbye
And Hades laid his hands on you
And gave you everlasting life!
And everlasting overtime
In the mine, the mill, and the machinery
Running his old assembly line
From Pluto to the Pleiades

FATES (COMPANY)
Way down Hadestown (Oh, keep your head, keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (Oh, you gotta keep your head low)
Way down Hadestown (If you wanna keep your head)
Way down under the ground!

EURYDICE (yelling)
There must be some mistake!

FATES (spoken)
Oh, it was a mistake alright!
And now you gotta pay-
And pay-
And pay for it, for the rest of your life!

HERMES (spoken)
See, it’s like I said before: a lot can happen behind closed doors.
Eurydice was a hungry young girl, but she wasn’t hungry anymore.
What she was, instead, was dead-
Dead to the world, anyway.
See, she went behind those doors
And signed her life away.

FATES
Saw that wheel up in the sky
Heard the big bell tolling
A lot of souls have gotta die
To keep the Rust Belt rolling
A lot of spirits gotta break
To make the underworld go ‘round

FATES & COMPANY
Way down Hadestown
Way down under the ground!

## Flowers 

EURYDICE
What I wanted was to fall asleep
Close my eyes and disappear
Like a petal on a stream, a feather on the air
Lily white and poppy red
I trembled when he laid me out
You won’t feel a thing, he said, when you go down
Nothing gonna wake you now
Dreams are sweet until they’re not
Men are kind until they aren’t
Flowers bloom until they rot and fall apart
Is anybody listening?
I open my mouth and nothing comes out
Nothing
Nothing gonna wake me now
Flowers, I remember fields
Of flowers, soft beneath my heels
Walking in the sun
I remember someone
Someone by my side
Turned his face to mine
And then I turned away
Into the shade
You, the one I left behind
If you ever walk this way
Come and find me lying in the bed I made

## Come Home With Me II

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Come home with me!

EURYDICE (spoken)
It’s you!

ORPHEUS (spoken)
It’s me.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Orpheus!

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Eurydice. Please, come home.
I’m not going back alone.

EURYDICE (spoken)
But how’d you get here? On the train?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Nah, I walked.
I walked and sang.

EURYDICE (spoken)
But how’d you get beyond the wall?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
I sang a song so beautiful the stones wept and they let me in.
And I can sing us home again.

EURYDICE (spoken)
No, you can’t.

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Yes I can.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Are you always this confident?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
When I look at you I am.

EURYDICE (spoken)
When you look at me, what do you see?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
I see someone stronger than me,
I see somebody who survives.
... I see my wife.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Why are you getting on your knees?

ORPHEUS (spoken)
I’m asking you to marry me. Marry me. Say “I do”.
I came all this way to ask you to.

EURYDICE (spoken)
Orpheus...

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Eurydice.

EURYDICE (spoken)
The two of us, you and me.
That is how it would have been, if the world was different.
But have you seen the world?
It isn’t beautiful! It doesn’t change for me and you,
No matter how much we want it to!

FATES
Can’t you see she made a deal?
Gave her word, took a vow
See, it’s all been signed and sealed
She belongs to Hades now
She belongs to him

ORPHEUS (spoken)
That isn’t true.

FATES
She belongs to him

ORPHEUS (spoken)
It isn’t true.

FATES
She belongs to him

ORPHEUS (spoken)
Say it isn’t true!

FATES
She belongs to him

EURYDICE (spoken)
I do.


## Papers

HADES (spoken)
Young man!
I don't think we've met before.
You're not from around here, son.
Don't know who the hell you are but I can tell you don't belong.
These are working people, son! Law-abiding citizens.
Go back to where you came from.
You're on the wrong side of the fence.

HERMES (spoken)
See, Orpheus was a poor boy.

HADES (spoken)
You hear me, son?

HERMES (spoken)
And Hades was a mighty king.

HADES
You better run!

HERMES (spoken)
But this poor boy raised up his voice, even though it was trembling.

ORPHEUS (spoken)
I'm not going back alone. I came to take her home.

HADES (spoken & laughs)
Who the hell do you think you are?
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
She couldn't go anywhere, even if she wanted to.
You're not from around here, son. If you were,
Then you would know that everyone and everything in Hadestown, I own.
As for you...
Everybody, gather around!
Everyone, come look and see what becomes of trespassers with no respect for property!

## Nothing Changes

FATES
Why the struggle, why the strain?
Why make trouble? Why make scenes?
Why go against the grain?
Why swim upstream?
It ain’t
It ain’t
It ain’t no use
You’re bound
You’re bound
You’re bound to lose
What’s done
What’s done
What’s done is done
That’s the way the river runs
So why get wet? Why break a sweat?
Why waste your precious breath?
Why beat your handsome brow?
Nothing changes
Nothing changes
Nothing changes anyhow

## If It's True 

ORPHEUS
If it’s true what they say
If my love is gone for good
They can take this heart away
They can take this flesh and blood
Take my mouth that kissed her mouth
Take my tongue that sung her praise
Take my arms that used to reach out
In the dark where she lay
If it’s true what they say
I’ll be on my way
If it’s true what they say
If there’s nothing to be done
If there’s no part to be played
If there’s no song to be sung
Take this voice, take these hands
I can’t use them anyway
Take this music and the memory
Of the muse from which it came
If it’s true what they say
I’ll be on my way
We can all be on our way
If it’s true what they say

But the ones who tell the lies
Are the solemnest to swear
And the ones who load the dice
Always say the toss is fair
And the ones who deal the cards
Are the ones who take the tricks
With their hands over their hearts
While we play the game they fix
And the ones who speak the words
Always say it is the last
And no answer will be heard
To the question no one asks
So I ask you as a brother
And I ask you as a friend
And I ask you as a lover
And I ask you once again
Is it true what they say?

## How Long

PERSEPHONE
Hades, my husband, Hades, my light
Hades, my darkness
If you had heard how he sang tonight
You’d pity poor Orpheus!
All of his sorrow won’t fit in his chest
It just burns like a fire in the pit of his chest
And his heart is a bird on a spit in his chest
How long, how long, how long?

HADES
How long? Just as long as Hades is King
Nothing comes of wishing on stars
And nothing comes of the songs people sing
However sorry they are
Give them a piece and they’ll take it all
Show them the crack and they’ll tear down the wall
Lend them an ear and the Kingdom will fall
The Kingdom will fall for a song

PERSEPHONE
What does he care for the logic of kings?
The laws of your underworld?
It is only for love that he sings!
He sings for the love of a girl

HADES
You and your pity don’t fit in my bed
You just burn like a fire in the pit of my bed
And I turn like a bird on a spit in my bed
How long, how long, how long?

PERSEPHONE
How long? Just as long as I am your wife
It’s true the earth must die
But then the earth comes back to life
And the sun just goes on rising

HADES & PERSEPHONE
And how does the sun even fit in the sky?
It just burns like a fire in the pit of the sky
And the earth is a bird on a spit in the sky
How long, how long, how long?

## Chant II

HERMES (spoken)
Now everybody knows the walls have ears

ORPHEUS
Is it true?

COMPANY
Is it true?

HERMES (spoken)
And the walls had heard what the boy was saying

ORPHEUS
Is it true?

COMPANY
Is it true?

HERMES
A million tons of stone and steel...

ORPHEUS
Is it true?

COMPANY
Is it true?

HERMES
Echoed his refrain.

HADES (laughs)
When I was a young man like you
Son, I held a woman too
Held her in my naked hands
When I was a young man
Now you know how it feels
Women are as slick as eels
Woman, quicker than the asp
Always slipping from your grasp

Take it from a man no longer young
If you want to hold a woman, son
Hang a chain around her throat
Made of many carat gold
Shackle her from wrist to wrist
With sterling silver bracelets
Fill her pockets full of stones
Precious ones, diamonds,
Bind her with a golden band
Take it from an old man

COMPANY
Low, keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head

ORPHEUS & EURYDICE
La la la la la la la...

COMPANY
Oh, he said he’d shelter us
He said he’d harbor me
He said we'd build them up
And then the walls would set us free
I’m gonna count to three
And then I’ll raise my head singing,
One, two, is it true?
Is it true, what he said?

PERSEPHONE
When I was a young girl like you
Sister, I was hungry too
Hungry for the underworld
When I was a young girl
Now you know how it tastes
The fruit of Mr. Hades’ ways
Sister, it’s a bitter wine--
Spit it out while you still have time

Take it from a woman of my age
Love is not a gilded cage
All the wealth within these walls
Will never buy the thing called love

Love was when he came to me
Begging on his bended knees
To please have pity on his heart
And let him lay me in the dirt...

I felt his arms around me then
We didn’t need a wedding bed
Dark seeds scattered on the ground
The wild birds were flying around

That’s when I became his wife
But that was in another life
That was in another world
When I was a young girl!

ORPHEUS & EURYDICE
La la la la la la la...

COMPANY
Low, keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head

Oh, he said he’d shelter us
He said he’d harbor me
He said we’d soldier on
And then the war would bring us peace
We’re gonna count to three
And then we'll raise our heads, singing
One, two, is it true?
Is it true, what he said?

HADES
Young man, I was young once too
I once sang the young man’s blues
Women come and women go
Get you high and get you low
One day she’s hot, the next she’s cold
Women are so seasonal
Women leave again and again
Take it from an old man

Now I sing a different song
One I can depend upon
The simple tune, the steady beat
The music of machinery
Do you hear that heavy metal sound?
The symphony of Hadestown
And in this symphony of mine
Of power chords and power lines
Young man, you can strum your lyre,
I have strung the world in wire
Young man, you can sing your ditty
I CONDUCT THE ELECTRIC CITY!

I’ll tell you what, young man
Since my wife is such a fan,
And since I’m going to count to three,
And put you out of your misery
One!-- give me one more song
One more song before I send you
Two!-- to the great beyond
Where nobody can hear you singing
Three!-- sing a song for me
Make me laugh, make me weep
Make the king feel young again
Sing for an old man!

## Epic (Part III)

ORPHEUS
Heavy and hard is the heart of the king
King of iron, king of steel
The heart of the king loves everything
Like the hammer loves the nail

But the heart of a man is a simple one
Small and soft, flesh and blood
And all that it loves is a woman
A woman is all that it loves

And Hades is King of the scythe and the sword
He covers the world in the color of rust
He scrapes the sky and scars the earth
And he comes down heavy and hard on us

But even that hardest of hearts unhardened
Suddenly, when he saw her there
Persephone in her mother’s garden
Sun on her shoulders, wind in her hair

The smell of the flowers she held in her hand
And the pollen that fell from her fingertips
And suddenly Hades was only a man
With a taste of nectar upon his lips, singing:
La la la la la la la…

COMPANY
La la la la la la la…

ORPHEUS
And what has become of the heart of that man,
Now that the man is King?
What has become of the heart of that man,
Now that he has everything?

The more he has, the more he holds,
The greater the weight of the world on his shoulders
See how he labors beneath that load
Afraid to look up, and afraid to let go
And he keeps his head low, and he keeps his back bending
He grows so afraid that he'll lose what he owns
But what he doesn't know is that what he's defending
Is already gone

Where is the treasure inside your chest?
Where is your pleasure? Where is your youth?
Where is the man with his hat in his hands?
Who stands in the garden with nothing to lose, singing:
La la la la la la la…

HADES
La la la la la la la…

ORPHEUS
La la la la la la la…

BOTH
La la la la la la la…


## Word to the Wise 

FATES
Gotta think quick
Gotta save face
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do now?

If you tell him no,
Oh, you’re a heartless man
And you’re gonna have a martyr on your hands
If you let him go,
Oh, you’re a spineless king
And you’re never gonna get them in line again

Damned if you don’t
Damned if you do
Whole damn nation’s watching you
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do,
Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do now?

Here’s a little tip
Word to the wise
Here’s a little snippet of advice:
Men are fools
Men are frail
Give them the rope and they’ll hang themselves

## His Kiss, The Riot 

HADES
The devil take this Orpheus
And his belladonna kiss
Beautiful and poisonous
Lovely! Deadly!

Now it thickens on my tongue
Now it quickens in my lung
Now I’m stricken! Now I’m stung!
It’s done already!

Dangerous this jack of hearts
With his kiss the riot starts

All my children came here poor
Clamoring for bed and board
Now what do they clamor for?
Freedom! Freedom!

Have I made myself their Lord
Just to fall upon the sword
Of some pauper’s minor chord?
Who will lead them?

Who lays all the best laid plans?
Who makes work for idle hands?

Only one thing to be done
Let them think that they have won
Let them leave together
Under one condition
Orpheus, the undersigned
Shall not turn to look behind
She’s out of sight!
And he’s out of his mind!

Every coward seems courageous
In the safety of the crowd
Bravery can be contagious
When the band is playing loud
Nothing makes a man so bold
As a woman’s smile and a hand to hold
But all alone his blood runs thin
And doubt comes, doubt comes in

## Promises

EURYDICE
Promises you made to me
You said the rivers and the trees
Would fill our pockets and our plates
Promises you made
You said the birds would blanket us
You said the world was generous
And wouldn’t turn its back on us

The river froze, the trees were bare
And all the birds, they disappeared
So me too, I flew away
From promises you made

ORPHEUS
Promises you made to me
You said that you would stay with me
Whatever weather came our way
Promises you made
That we would walk, side by side
Through all the seasons of our lives
'Neath any sky, down any road
Any way the wind blows

I have no ring for your finger
I have no banquet table laid
I have no bed of feathers
Whatever promises I’ve made
Can’t promise you fair sky above
Can’t promise you kind road below
But I’ll walk with you, my love
Any way the wind blows

EURYDICE
I don’t need gold, don’t need silver
Just bread when I’m hungry, fire when I’m cold
Don’t need a ring for my finger
Just need a steady hand to hold
Don’t promise me fair sky above
Don’t promise me kind road below
Just walk with me, my love
Any way the wind blows

ORPHEUS
I don’t know where this road will end
But I’ll walk with you into the wind

BOTH
I can’t promise you fair sky above
Can’t promise you kind road below
But I’ll walk with you, my love
Any way the wind blows

ORPHEUS
Do you let me walk with you?

EURYDICE
I do

ORPHEUS
I do

BOTH
I do

EURYDICE
And keep on walking, come what will?

ORPHEUS
I will

EURYDICE
I will

BOTH
We will

## Wait For Me II

HERMES (spoken)
Meanest dog you’ll ever meet -
It ain’t the hound dog in the street.
He bares his teeth and tears your skin
But brother, that’s the worst of him.
The dog you really got to dread
Is the one that howls inside your head.
It's him whose howling drives men mad
And a mind to its undoing.

PERSEPHONE (spoken)
You think they’ll make it?

HADES (spoken)
I don’t know.

PERSEPHONE (spoken)
Hades, you let them go.

HADES (spoken)
I let them try.

PERSEPHONE (spoken)
Then how ‘bout you and I?
Are we gonna try again?

HADES (spoken)
It’s almost spring.
We’ll try again next fall.

PERSEPHONE (spoken)
Wait for me?

HADES (spoken)
I will.

COMPANY
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too

HERMES (spoken)
You got a lonesome road to walk.
It ain’t along the railroad track.
It ain’t along the black-top tar
You’ve walked a hundred times before.
I’ll tell you where the real road lies:
Between your ears, behind your eyes.
That is the path to Paradise,
And, likewise, the road to ruin.

COMPANY
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too
Wait, wait-

EURYDICE
Wait.
Wait...


## Doubt Comes In

ORPHEUS & FATES
Doubt comes in
And strips the paint
Doubt comes in
And turns the wine
Doubt comes in and leaves a trace
Of vinegar and turpentine
Where are you? Where are you now?
Doubt comes in
And kills the lights
Doubt comes in
And chills the air
Doubt comes in and all falls silent
It’s as though you aren’t there
Where are you? Where are you now?

EURYDICE
Orpheus
You’re shivering
Is it cold or fear?
Just keep singing
The coldest night
Of the coldest year
Comes right before the spring

ORPHEUS & FATES
Doubt comes in
With tricky fingers
Doubt comes in
With fickle tongues
Doubt comes in and my heart falters
And forgets the songs it sung
Where are you? Where are you now?

EURYDICE
Orpheus
Hold on
Hold on tight
It won’t be long
’cause the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
Comes right before the dawn


## Road to Hell II

HERMES (mumbles and sighs)
Alright, alright
It’s an old song
It’s an old tale from way back when
It’s an old song
And we’re gonna sing it again and again

We’re gonna sing it again

There was a railroad line on a road to Hell
There was a young man down on bended knee
And that is the ending of the tale
Of Orpheus and Eurydice

It’s a sad song
It’s a sad tale, it’s a tragedy
It’s a sad song
But we sing it anyway

(sighs and spoken)
Cause, here’s the thing
To know how it ends
And still begin to sing it again
As if it might turn out this time
I learned that from a friend of mine

See, Orpheus was a poor boy
But he had a gift to give:
He could make you see how the world could be,
In spite of the way that it is

Can you see it?
Can you hear it?
Can you feel it like a train?
Is it coming?
Is it coming this a-way?

(sung)
On a sunny day there was a railroad car
And a lady stepping off a train
Everybody looked and everybody saw
That spring had come again

With a love song
With a tale of a love that never dies
With a love song
For anyone who tries.

## I Raise My Cup

EURYDICE
Pour the wine and raise a cup
Drink up, brothers, you know how
And spill a drop for Orpheus
Wherever he is now

PERSEPHONE
Some birds sing when the sun shines bright
My praise is not for them
But the one who sings in the dead of night
I raise my cup to him

EURYDICE
Wherever he is wandering
Alone upon the earth
Let all our singing follow him
And bring him comfort
Some flowers bloom when the green grass grows
My praise is not for them
But the one who blooms in the bitter snow
I raise my cup to him

PERSEPHONE
I raise my cup and drink it up

EURYDICE
I raise it high and drink it dry

PERSEPHONE
To Orpheus and all of us
Goodnight, brothers, goodnight
