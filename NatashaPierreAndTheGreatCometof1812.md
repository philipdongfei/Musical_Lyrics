# Natasha Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812
<br>
## SYNOPSIS
<br>
### Act 1
<br>
The story is set in Moscow, 1812, just before Napoleon's invasion of Russia and the burning of the city. As the story begins ("Prologue"), Pierre, a wealthy aristocrat, is having an existential crisis, living a slothful life of wine, philosophy, and inaction ("Pierre"). He is best friends with Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, who has left to go to war. Andrey has recently become engaged to the young, beautiful countess Natasha Rostova. Natasha and her cousin Sonya arrive in Moscow to stay the winter with Natasha's godmother, Marya D., while Natasha waits for Andrey to return from the war. Marya D. is an old friend of Pierre's ("Moscow"). Marya D. advises Natasha that she must visit her future in-laws, the demented old Prince Bolkonsky and his pitiable spinster daughter Mary ("The Private and Intimate Life of the House"), to win their affection in advance of the marriage, which is critical to the status and fortune of the Rostov family. However, Natasha's visit with Mary and Bolkonsky ends in disaster ("Natasha & Bolkonskys"), as Mary finds Natasha vain, Natasha finds Mary cold, and Bolkonsky behaves bizarrely. Natasha leaves their home missing Andrey more than ever ("No One Else").<br>
<br>
The next night Natasha is introduced to decadent Moscow society after an extravagant performance at "The Opera". There she meets Prince Anatole Kuragin, a young and handsome man and, it turns out, a notorious rogue ("Natasha & Anatole"); their interaction leaves Natasha feeling confused.<br>
<br>
Anatole, his friend Dolokhov, and Pierre go out drinking; they are met by Pierre's unpleasant wife, Hélène (Anatole's sister), who taunts Pierre and flirts with Dolokhov. Anatole plots with Dolokhov and Hélène to to have the young woman he just met, although he is already married. Pierre finds his wife's familiarity with Dolokhov offensive and drunkenly challenges him to a duel, accidentally wounding Dolokhov. When it is Dolokhov's turn to shoot, Pierre stands openly in front of the bullet, but Dolokhov miraculously misses him ("The Duel"). Alone, Pierre reflects on his near-death experience and realizes that despite wasting his life, he wishes to live ("Dust and Ashes").<br>
<br>
Natasha and her family go to church ("Sunday Morning"). Hélène finds it amusing to encourage her brother Anatole's conquest of the young countess Natasha, which she knows would lead to Natasha's ruin. Hélène visits Natasha and invites her to the ball that night ("Charming"), where Anatole seduces Natasha, and she persuades herself that she loves him ("The Ball").<br>
<br>
### Act 2
<br>
Anatole and Natasha make plans to elope (she still does not know that he is married), and Natasha tearfully breaks off her engagement with Andrey ("Letters"). Sonya finds out about the plan and realizes it will mean Natasha's ruin ("Sonya & Natasha"); Sonya determines to save Natasha from herself even if it means she will lose her closest friend ("Sonya Alone"). That evening Anatole and Dolokhov plan for the elopement ("Preparations"), and Dolokhov tries to change Anatole's mind with no success. Balaga, Their trusted troika driver ("Balaga"), soon arrives to take them to Natasha's house and a wild party ensues as Anatole bids farewell to his friends. However, they are thwarted at the last moment by Marya D. ("The Abduction"). Marya D. scolds Natasha but then tries to comfort her with Sonya's help. Natasha screams at them, breaks down and waits for Anatole to come back for her all night ("In My House").<br>
<br>
Marya D. calls on Pierre in the middle of the night ("A Call to Pierre"), begging him to handle the crisis, and Pierre finally learns that the object of Anatole's conquest is Natasha. Marya D. finds out that Anatole is married and tells a grief-stricken Natasha. Pierre, outraged, searches for Anatole ("Find Anatole"). When Pierre finds Anatole, he comes close to attacking him in rage, but instead gives him money and orders him to leave Moscow ("Pierre & Anatole"). Natasha poisons herself with arsenic ("Natasha Very Ill") but lives. The next day Andrey returns. Pierre explains the scandal to him and asks him to be compassionate, but Andrey is unable to forgive Natasha and will not ask for her hand in marriage again ("Pierre & Andrey"). Finally, Pierre visits Natasha ("Pierre & Natasha") and he comforts the distraught girl, giving her hope. After their meeting, Pierre experiences a moment of enlightenment himself while seeing The Great Comet of 1812 in the night sky.<br>

## Pierre
<br>
PIERRE<br>
It's dawned on me suddenly<br>
And for no obvious reason<br>
That I can't go on<br>
Living as I am<br>
<br>
The zest of life has vanished<br>
Only the skeleton remains<br>
Unexpectedly vile<br>
I used to be better<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank<br>
Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric<br>
A warm-hearted Russian of the old school<br>
His purse is always empty<br>
Cuz it's open to all<br>
O Pierre<br>
Just one of a hundred sad old men<br>
Living out their final days in Moscow<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
I drank too much<br>
Right now, my friend fights and bleeds<br>
And I sit at home and read<br>
Hours at a time<br>
Hours at my screen<br>
Anything, anything<br>
Abandoned to distraction<br>
In order to forget<br>
We waste our lives<br>
Drowning in wine<br>
<br>
I never thought that I'd end up like this<br>
I used to better<br>
<br>
And the women they all pity me<br>
Cuz I'm married<br>
But not in love<br>
Frozen at the center<br>
<br>
WOMEN<br>
Il est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe<br>
He is charming; he has no sex<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank<br>
Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric<br>
A warm-hearted Russian of the old school<br>
His purse is always empty<br>
Cuz it's open to all<br>
O Pierre<br>
Just one of a hundred sad old men<br>
Living out their final days in Moscow<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
There's a ringing in my head<br>
There's a sickness in the world<br>
And everyone knows<br>
But pretends that they don't see<br>
“Oh, I'll sort it out later”<br>
But later never comes<br>
<br>
PIERRE & MEN<br>
And how many men before<br>
Good Russian men<br>
Believing in goodness and truth<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Entered that door<br>
With all their teeth and hair<br>
And left it toothless and bald<br>
<br>
You empty and stupid<br>
Contented fellows<br>
Satisfied with your place<br>
I'm different from you<br>
I'm different from you<br>
I still want to do something<br>
<br>
Or do you struggle too?<br>
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you<br>
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you<br>
<br>

Ah...<br>

I will touch you on the cheek<br>

<br>

She said<br>
Gazing at Marya with kind, glittering eyes<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Welcome<br>
Welcome to Moscow<br>
Scruffy and cozy<br>
Like an old dressing gown<br>
<br>

<br>
SONYA<br>
How beautiful you looked in the snow<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Cousin dear I love you<br>
Trust no one but you<br>
But I can't bear this waiting<br>
I cry and I cry<br>
ANDREY where are you?<br>
I want him now, at once<br>
To embrace him and cling to him<br>
No one can understand<br>
<br>
I love him<br>
I know him<br>
He loves me only<br>
He'll come home one day<br>
And take me away<br>
I want nothing more<br>
I want nothing more<br>
<br>
Hmmm...<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
First thing tomorrow to Madame Chambord's<br>
Dresses, dresses, we'll buy what we can afford<br>
Then dinner and a game of Boston<br>
Then you'll read to me while I knit!<br>
How wonderful to have you here<br>
Instead of these gossips and crybabies<br>
<br>
NATASHA & SONYA<br>
You'll take us where we must go<br>
Pet us a bit<br>
And scold us a bit<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Her goddaughter, her favorite, Natasha<br>
She will touch you on the cheek<br>
<br>
(Sonya leaves)<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Well, now we'll talk<br>
I congratulate you and ANDREY<br>
You've hooked a fine fellow!<br>
One of the finest matches in all of Russia<br>
I am glad and relieved,<br>
He'll be the family's saving grace<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I blush happily<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
But his father, Prince Bolkonsky, much dislikes his son's marrying<br>
The old fellow's crotchety!<br>
Of course Prince Andrey's not a child<br>
But it's not nice to enter a family against a father's will<br>
One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly<br>
But you're a clever girl<br>
Just be kind to Andrey's sister<br>
And when the sister loves you,<br>
So will the father<br>
And all will be well<br>
<br>
## The Private and Intimate Life of the House
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
I've aged<br>
I've aged so very much<br>
I fall asleep at the table<br>
My napkin drops to the floor<br>
<br>
I'm full of childish vanities<br>
I forget things<br>
And I love in the past<br>
I've aged so very much<br>
<br>
People enjoy me though<br>
I come in for tea in my old-fashioned coat and powered wig<br>
And I tell stories<br>
And utter scathing critiques<br>
<br>
This old-fashioned house<br>
With its gigantic mirrors and powered footmen<br>
And this stern, shrewd old man<br>
A relic of the past century<br>
With his gentle daughter<br>
Is a majestic and agreeable spectacle<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
But besides the couple hours during which we have guests<br>
There are also twenty-two hours in the day<br>
During which the private and intimate life of the house continues<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Bring me my slippers<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
Yes father yes father<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Bring me my wine<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
Yes father yes father<br>
Oh father<br>
<br>
And I never go anywhere<br>
Never invited<br>
For who would take care of him<br>
Who would take care<br>
<br>
MARY & BOLKONSKY<br>
And I have no friends<br>
No no no<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Girl, all my friends are dead<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
No one<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
All my friends are dead<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
Time is moving<br>
It's now or never<br>
My fate is slipping past me<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Silence! Silence!<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
Yes father yes father<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Shut your damn mouth girl<br>
Shut your damn mouth<br>
I can hurt you<br>
<br>
MARY & BOLKONSKY<br>
I can hurt you<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
But I never ever ever ever would<br>
This is just how it is<br>
It's just how he is<br>
I'm always to blame<br>
<br>
He could beat me<br>
Or treat me like a dog<br>
Make me fetch wood or water<br>
And that's just how it is<br>
Oh father<br>
I love you father<br>
<br>
Time is moving<br>
It's now or never<br>
I've abandoned the hope of getting married<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Ah! What's this, a young suitor?<br>
Ah, come in come in<br>
<br>
But don't sit down<br>
Don't sit down<br>
I'm cold to you<br>
Yes I'm mean to you<br>
Now be gone be gone be gone<br>
And don't come back!<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll marry someone myself<br>
Some cheap French thing<br>
Oh that offends you does it?<br>
Ah, come in my dear, come in my dear, come in<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
And he draws her to him<br>
And he kisses her hand<br>
Embraces her affectionately<br>
And I flush and run out of the room<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
Come back here<br>
Let an old man have his fun<br>
Wipe away your tears girl<br>
I don't want your tears<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
On that horrible woman<br>
Vile and inhuman<br>
She's using you, Papa<br>
Wants your money Papa<br>
To take advantage of your weakness like that<br>
It's disgusting<br>
My voice breaks<br>
<br>
BOLKONSKY<br>
It's my money<br>
And I'll throw it where I want<br>
Not at you!<br>
And not at Andrey's harlot!<br>
It's my money, my money,<br>
Mine all mine!<br>
<br>
Insolent girl!<br>
Insolent girl!<br>
Where-<br>
Where-<br>
<br>
Where are my glasses?<br>
Where are, where are they?<br>
Where are my glasses?<br>
Where are-<br>
Where-<br>
<br>
Oh God-<br>
Oh God I'm frightened<br>
Oh God I've-<br>
I've aged, I've aged so very much<br>
Oh God I'm frightened<br>
Where-<br>
Where are my glasses?<br>
Where are my, where are my-<br>
Where are my glasses?<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
There are there upon his head<br>
They are there upon his head<br>
The pride of sacrifice<br>
Gathers in my soul<br>
They are there upon his head<br>
<br>
And he forgets things<br>
He lives in the past<br>
He falls asleep at the table<br>
His napkin drops to the floor<br>
His shaking head<br>
Sinks over his plate<br>
<br>
He is old and feeble<br>
And I dare to judge him<br>
I disgust myself<br>
I disgust myself<br>
<br>
## No One Else
<br>
NATASHA<br>
The moon -<br>
First time I heard your voice<br>
Moonlight burst into the room<br>
And I saw your eyes<br>
And I saw your smile<br>
And the world opened wide<br>
And the world was inside of me<br>
<br>
And I catch my breath<br>
And I laugh and blush<br>
And I hear guitars<br>
You are so good for me<br>
<br>
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you<br>
<br>
Oh the moon<br>
Oh the snow in the moonlight<br>
And your childlike eyes<br>
And your distant smile<br>
I'll never be this happy again<br>
You and I<br>
And no one else<br>
<br>
We've done this all before<br>
We were angels once<br>
Don't you remember?<br>
Joy and life<br>
Inside our souls<br>
And nobody knows<br>
Just you and me<br>
It's our secret<br>
<br>
This winter sky<br>
How can anyone sleep?<br>
There was never such a night before!<br>
I feel like putting my arms round my knees<br>
And squeezing tight as possible<br>
And flying away<br>
Like this...<br>
<br>
Oh the moon<br>
Oh the snow in the moonlight<br>
And your childlike eyes<br>
And your distant smile<br>
I'll never be this happy again<br>
You and I<br>
You and I<br>
You and I<br>
And no one else<br>
<br>
Maybe he'll come today<br>
Maybe he came already<br>
And he's sitting in the drawing room<br>
And I simply forgot<br>

SERVANT<br>
Announcing Fedya Dolokhov<br>
He dominates Moscow's most brilliant young men<br>
He stands in full view<br>
Well aware he's attracting attention<br>
Yet as much as ease as though he were in his own room<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Dolokhov was in the Caucasus<br>
And he killed the Shah's brother!<br>

Now Natasha<br>
The curtain rises<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
The curtain rises<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Everyone in the boxes and the stalls became silent<br>
All the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress<br>
All the women in the hall<br>
With gems on their bare flesh<br>
Turned their whole attention<br>
With curiosity to the stage<br>
<br>
(Two singers perform a scene from an avant-garde opera.<br>
It is grotesque and amazing.)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Grotesque and amazing<br>
I cannot follow the opera<br>
Or even listen to the music<br>
I see painted cardboard<br>
Queerly dressed actors<br>
Moving and singing so strangely in the lights<br>
So false and unnatural<br>
I'm ashamed and amused<br>
And everyone else seems oblivious<br>
Yes everyone feigns delight<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
And feeling the flood of brilliant lights,<br>
The warm perfumed air heated by the crowd,<br>
Natasha little by little<br>
Began to pass into a state of intoxication<br>
<br>
(Natasha joins the singers in the opera.)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh I'd tickle you all if I could<br>
Oh I'd tickle you all if I could<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
And then<br>
A rush of cold air<br>
<br>
NATASHA & SONYA<br>
An exceptionally handsome man walked in<br>
With a confident yet courteous air<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
This was Helene's brother<br>
Anatole Kuragin<br>
He moved with a swagger<br>
Which would have been ridiculous<br>
Had he not been so good-looking<br>
And though it was the middle of the act<br>
He walked right down the aisle<br>
His sword and spurs jangling<br>
His handsome perfumed head held high<br>
And he looked right at Natasha<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Mais Charmante<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
And he took his place in the front row next to Dolokhov<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
How handsome he is<br>
How intoxicating<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
In the second act there were tombstones<br>
The moon over the footlights<br>
Horns and contrabass<br>
Black cloaks and daggers in their hands<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I turn around again and our eyes meet<br>
He gazes straight into my eyes<br>
He is talking about me<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Candles burning<br>
A crimson throne<br>
The Tsar wails a mournful tune<br>
They all wave their arms<br>
And everybody cheers<br>
“Bravo, bravo!”<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Everytime I look at him<br>
He's looking at me<br>
Everytime I look at him<br>
He's looking at me<br>
Everytime I look at him<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
A terrible noise, a clutter in the crowd<br>
A storm of chromatic scales and diminished sevenths<br>
With rapturous faces everyone was shouting<br>
Screaming and shouting, “Bravo!”<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Bravo, bravo<br>
Bravo, bravo<br>
Bravo, bravo<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
And then<br>
A rush of COLD air<br>
And Anatole entered the box<br>
<br>
## Natasha & Anatole
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
I have long wished to have this happiness<br>
Ever since the Naryshkins' ball<br>
Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you<br>
How do you like the performance?<br>
Last week Semenova fell down on the stage<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
He is sensible and simple<br>
Bold and natural,<br>
So strange and agreeable<br>
There is nothing formidable<br>
His smile is most naïve,<br>
Cheerful and good-natured<br>
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance<br>
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And do you know, Natasha<br>
We are having a costume tournament soon<br>
You ought to come, please come!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh -<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
You ought to come, please come!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh I -<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And I never remove my smiling eyes<br>
From your face, your neck, your bare arms<br>
And I never remove my smiling eyes<br>
From your face, your neck, your bare arms<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I know for certain that he is taken by me<br>
I know for certain that he is enraptured by me<br>
I feel him looking at my shoulders<br>
My face, my neck, my bare arms<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And I look you in the eye<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
And I look you in the eye<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And looking into his eyes<br>
I am frightened<br>
There's not that barrier of modesty<br>
I've always felt with men<br>
I feel so terribly near<br>
I fear that he may seize me from behind<br>
And kiss me on the neck<br>
<br>
How do you like Moscow?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
At first I did not like it much<br>
Because what makes a town pleasant<br>
Ce sont les jolies femmes<br>
Isn't that so?<br>
But now I like it very much indeed<br>
Do come to the costume tournament Countess,<br>
Do come!<br>
You will be the prettiest there<br>
You will be the prettiest there<br>
Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge<br>
<br>
We are speaking of most ordinary things<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Yet I feel closer to you than I've ever felt with any other man<br>
No one else is here<br>
No one else can see us<br>
Your eyes<br>
Your eyes<br>
Your eyes<br>
Oh your eyes<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
It's all right, Natasha, I'm here<br>
It's all right, Natasha, I'm here<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And I -<br>
I cannot speak<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
Look straight into my eyes<br>
Nearness<br>
Tenderness<br>
Smile at me<br>
Gaze straight into my eyes<br>
There is no barrier between us<br>
There is nothing between us<br>
Nothing between us<br>
<br>
(Anatole leaves)<br>
<br>
## Natasha Lost
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I smile, I shake<br>
And the opera continues<br>
And I'm quite submissive to the world I am in<br>
My previous life is slipping away from me<br>
My distant past is gone, is gone<br>
<br>
And the rest of the night<br>
I can't take my eyes from him<br>
His glittering eyes<br>
And his tender smile<br>
<br>
And as I am leaving<br>
Flushed and nervous<br>
He touches my arm<br>
And I turn around<br>
And he's looking at me<br>
With his glittering eyes<br>
And his tender smile<br>
<br>
O God! I am lost!<br>
How could I let him?<br>
Everything is dark, obscure, and terrible<br>
I don't understand this<br>
O God! I am lost!<br>
<br>
Back in the theater, full of lights<br>
Where tenors jumped about in tinsel jackets<br>
Young girls and old men cried “bravo!” in repture<br>
There it all seemed simple<br>
But now, alone<br>
I am tortured<br>
<br>
My conscience gnaws away at my heart<br>
Am I spoiled for Andrey's love or not?<br>
Oh I can soothe myself with irony:<br>
Nothing! It was nothing<br>
I didn't lead him on at all<br>
No one will ever know<br>
I'll never see him again<br>
Nothing has happened<br>
And Andrey can love me still<br>
O God, why isn't he here?<br>
<br>
And yet it was like there was nothing between us<br>
No veil, no modesty<br>
Just his face and strong hands<br>
His glittering eyes<br>
And his tender smile<br>
That bold handsome man who pressed my arm<br>
<br>
## The Duel 
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Good evening Pierre<br>
Studying?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Yes. How was the opera?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Lovely<br>
Natalya Rostova was there<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Oh, oh that charming young girl?<br>
I have known her since she was a child<br>
And long carried affection for her<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Yes, charming<br>
Look, Dolokhov's coming round and we are off to the Club<br>
Will you come old man?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
I will come<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Lend me fifty rubles?<br>
<br>
(Dolokhov arrives with many bottles of vodka)<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Drink drink<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink<br>
Gonna drink<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV, ANATOLE & PIERRE<br>
Drink drink<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna<br>
Gonna drink<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
Gonna drink tonight<br>
<br>
(They drink and dance)<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
Drink with me my love<br>
For there's fire in the sky<br>
And there's ice on the ground<br>
Either way my soul will die<br>
Whoa....<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
The doctors warn me<br>
That with my corpulence<br>
Vodka and wine are dangerous for me<br>
<br>
But I drink a great deal<br>
Only quite at ease<br>
After pouring several glasses<br>
Mechanically into my large mouth<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
Then I feel<br>
A pleasant warmth in my body,<br>
A sentimental attachment to my fellow men<br>
<br>
(Helene arrives and sidles up to Dolokhov.)<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
<br>
ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
<br>
HELENE, ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV<br>
Drink the whole night through<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
Drink the whole night through<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
<br>
(Pierre continues to drink, too much)<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Now Anatole,<br>
What women tonight?<br>
Moscow ladies<br>
Or gypsy girls?<br>
French actresses?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Just no more unmarried heiresses!<br>
So plain and boring<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
And a little too dangerous eh?<br>
Anatole is a married man<br>
A fact known only to his intimates<br>
A Polish landowner of some small means<br>
Had forced him to marry his daughter<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Nevermind about that now,<br>
It doesn't matter, I don't give a damn<br>
Just as a duck is made to swim in water<br>
God has made me as I am<br>
All I care for is gaiety and women<br>
And there's no dishonor in that<br>
As long as there's money and vodka<br>
I'll keep a feather in my hat<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
Whoa....<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
I used to love<br>
I used to love<br>
I used to be better<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Keep drinking old man<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Yes drink drink drink<br>
Drink drink drink<br>
God, to think I married a man like you<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Don't speak to me, wife<br>
There is something inside me<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Dolokhov pour me another<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Something terrible and monstrous<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Here's to the health of married women!<br>
And a smile lurks at the corner of my mouth<br>
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV & CHORUS<br>
Here's to the health of married women!<br>
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!<br>
Here's to the health of married women!<br>
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
How dare you touch her?<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
You can't love her<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Enough!<br>
You bully, you scoundrel!<br>
I challenge you!<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Oh, a duel!<br>
Yes, this is what I like<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
He will kill you!<br>
Stupid husband!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
So I shall be killed!<br>
What is it to you!<br>
Anatole, my guns<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Oh! This is horribly stupid<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Just show me where to go<br>
And tell me when to shoot<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Just wait till you\'re close enough<br>
You'll never hit him from forty paces<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Well, let's begin!<br>
This is child's play<br>
<br>
SERVANT (DENISOV)<br>
As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, we shall please proceed with the duel<br>
Ready your pistols, and on the count of tri, begin to advance<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
Rahz! Dva! Tri!<br>
<br>
(They start towards each other.)<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Pierre, hold your fire<br>
Pierre, hold your fire<br>
Pierre, not yet!<br>
<br>
(Pierre fires early; Dolokhov is hit)<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
No!...<br>
My turn<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
My turn<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Pierre, stand back!<br>
<br>
(Pierre walks toward Dolokhov with his chest exposed. Dolokhov fires.)<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Missed<br>
Missed<br>
Oh my mother, my angel,<br>
My adored angel mother!<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Take him away<br>
<br>
(Anatole carries Dolokhov out.)<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Missed<br>
Missed<br>
Such a storm of feelings<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
You are a fool<br>
<br>
(Pierre leaves. Anatole returns.)<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natasha, Natasha<br>
Her arms, her shoulders<br>
Her neck, her feet<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
The air of connoisseur<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
I will make love to her<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
And what will come of it?<br>
She's first-rate, my dear, but she's not for you<br>
You'd better wait till she's married<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
You know, I adore little girls,<br>
They lose their heads at once<br>
<br>
Ask her to dinner, eh?<br>
Sweet sister<br>
<br>
## Dust and Ashes
<br>
PIERRE -<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Ridiculed and laughed at<br>
Wearing clown shoes<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Furious and reckless<br>
Sick with booze<br>
<br>
How did I live?<br>
I taste every wasted minute<br>
Every time I turned away<br>
From the things that might have healed me<br>
How long have I been sleeping?<br>
<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Frightened like a child<br>
Lazy and numb<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Pretending and preposterous<br>
And dumb<br>
<br>
How did I live?<br>
Was I kind enough and good enough?<br>
Did I love enough?<br>
Did I ever look up<br>
And see the moon<br>
And the stars<br>
And the sky?<br>
Oh why have I been sleeping?<br>
<br>
They say we are asleep<br>
Until we fall in love<br>
We are children of dust and ashes<br>
But when we fall in love we wake up<br>
And we are a God<br>
And angels weep<br>
But if I die here tonight<br>
I die in my sleep<br>
<br>
All of my life I spent searching the words<br>
Of poets and saints and prophets and kings<br>
And now at the end all I know that I’ve learned<br>
Is that all that I know is I don’t know a thing<br>
<br>
So easy to close off<br>
Place the blame outside<br>
Hiding in my room at night<br>
So terrified<br>
All the things I could have been<br>
But I never had the nerve<br>
Life and love<br>
I don’t deserve<br>
<br>
So all right, all right<br>
I’ve had my time<br>
Close my eyes<br>
Let the death bells chime<br>
<br>
Bury me in burgundy<br>
I just don’t care<br>
Nothing’s left<br>
I looked everywhere<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Was there ever any other way my life could be?<br>
Is this how I die?<br>
Such a storm of feelings inside of me?<br>
<br>
But then why am I screaming?<br>
Why am I shaking?<br>
Oh God, was there something that I missed?<br>
Did I squander my divinity?<br>
Was happiness within me the whole time?<br>
<br>
They say we are asleep<br>
Until we fall in love<br>
We are children of dust and ashes<br>
But when we fall in love we wake up<br>
And we are a God<br>
And angels weep<br>
But if I die here tonight<br>
I die in my sleep<br>
<br>
They say we are asleep<br>
Until we fall in love<br>
And I’m so ready<br>
To wake up now<br>
<br>
I want to wake up<br>
Don’t let me die while I’m like this<br>
I want to wake up<br>
God don’t let me die while I’m like this<br>
Please let me wake up now<br>
God don’t let me die while I’m like this<br>
I’m ready<br>
I’m ready<br>
To wake up<br>
<br>
## Sunday Morning
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Has Andrey arrived?<br>
Has Andrey arrived?<br>
He has not arrived<br>
He will never come<br>
Or something will happen to me before he does<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Come to church dear<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Marya Dmitryevna likes Sundays and knows how to keep them<br>
The whole house has been scrubbed and cleaned<br>
Roast goose and suckling pig filled our noses with glee<br>
We wear holiday dresses<br>
Travel by troika to church<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
God is everywhere<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I suffer more now than before<br>
The theater and Anatole<br>
That man who aroused such terrible feelings<br>
I don't understand<br>
Have I broken faith with Andrey?<br>
Am I guilty?<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
After church, Marya left for Prince Bolkonsky's<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
The rudeness of that man!<br>
I'll straighten him out!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
That terrible old Prince<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
There, there Natasha<br>
It's not your fault<br>
Here, kiss me<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I can't bear to think of it<br>
I'll shut myself in my room<br>
And try on new dresses<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
And just after Marya left<br>
There was a knock at the door<br>
Natasha had just turned her head to the glass<br>
When she heard a voice that made her flush<br>
<br>
## Charming
<br>
HÉLÈNE:<br>
Oh my enchantress<br>
Oh you beautiful thing Charming, charming No, this is really beyond anything<br>
These dresses suit you<br>
This one, “metallic gauze” Straight from Paris Anything suits you, my charmer<br>
<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Charmante, charmante! You are such a lovely thing<br>
<br>
Oh where have you been<br>
It’s such a shame to bury pearls in the country Charmante, charmante, charming<br>
<br>
Now if you have a dress You must wear it out<br>
How can you live in Moscow and not go nowhere?<br>
So you love somebody, charming But that’s no reason to shut yourself in<br>
Even if you’re engaged You must wear your dress out somewhere<br>
<br>
My brother dined with me yesterday But he didn’t eat a thing<br>
Cuz he was thinking ‘bout you He kept sighing ‘bout you<br>
<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Charmante, charmante! You are such a lovely thing<br>
<br>
Oh where have you been<br>
It’s such a shame to bury pearls in the country Charmante, charmante, charming<br>
<br>
Now a woman with a dress<br>
<br>
Is a frightening and powerful thing<br>
You are not a child When you’re draped in scarlet and lace<br>
Your fiancé would want you to have fun Rather than be bored to death<br>
<br>
Allez dans la monde plutôt que de périr d'ennui!<br>
<br>
My brother is quite madly in love He is quite madly in love with you, my dear<br>
<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!<br>
Charmante, charmante! You are such a lovely thing<br>
<br>
Oh where have you been<br>
It’s such a shame to bury pearls in the country Charmante, charmante, charming<br>
It’s such a shame to bury pearls in the country Charmante, charmante, charming<br>
It’s such a shame to bury pearls in the country Charmante, charmante, charming<br>
<br>
## The Ball
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting<br>
<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting<br>
<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting at the door<br>
Waiting<br>
And there she is<br>
<br>
(The ball begins; they dance)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear<br>
There is no barrier between us<br>
Whispers and moans and ringing in my ear<br>
There is no barrier between us<br>
Divine, delicious<br>
But I do not see or hear anything<br>
I'm borne away to a senseless world<br>
So strange, so remote<br>
I don't know good from bad<br>
Anatole<br>
Anatole<br>
I\'m so frightened<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
You are enchanting<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And as we danced he pressed my waist and hand<br>
And told me I was<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
Bewitching<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And I love you<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
Bewitching<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And I love you<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And during the ecossaise, he<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
Gazed in my eyes<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
My frightened eyes<br>
<br>
Such confident tenderness<br>
I could not say what I had to say<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Don't lower your eyes<br>
I love you<br>
I am in love dear<br>
I am in love<br>
<br>
Gaze in my eyes<br>
I love you<br>
You are bewitching<br>
What can I do<br>
Darling what can I do<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Don't say such things<br>
I am betrothed<br>
I love another<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Don't speak to me of that!<br>
When I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you!<br>
Is it my fault that you're enchanting?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I'm so frightened<br>
I don't understand anything tonight<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
I'm here now<br>
<br>
(Natasha breaks away)<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natalie!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I can feel your eyes upon me<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Blocking her path, I bring her face close to mine<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine<br>
That I see nothing else<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Is it possible that I should never see you again?<br>
I love you madly!<br>
Can I never?<br>
Natalie?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
You press my arm<br>
You press my arm<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natalie?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
You're hurting my hands<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natalie?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I don't understand<br>
I have nothing to say<br>
<br>
(They kiss)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Burning lips press to mine<br>
Tell me what just happened<br>
<br>
I'm trembling<br>
So frightened<br>
<br>
Andrey<br>
<br>
But I love you<br>
Of that there is no doubt<br>
How else could all of this have happened?<br>
How else could we have kissed?<br>
It means that I have loved you from the first<br>
It means that you are kind, noble, and splendid<br>
And I could not help loving you<br>
<br>
I will love you Anatole<br>
I'll do anything for you<br>
<br>
NATASHA & ANATOLE<br>
I'll do anything for you<br>
<br>
## Letters
<br>
ALL<br>
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters<br>
We write letters<br>
We put down in writing<br>
What is happening in our minds<br>
<br>
Once it's on the paper we feel better<br>
We feel better<br>
It's like some kind of clarity<br>
When the letter's done and signed<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Dear Andrey<br>
Dear old friend<br>
How goes the war?<br>
Do we march on the French splendidly?<br>
Do our cannons crack and cry?<br>
Do our bullets whistle and sing?<br>
Does the air reek with smoke?<br>
I wish I were there<br>
With death at my heels<br>
<br>
Dolokhov is recovering<br>
He will be all right, the good man<br>
It should have been me<br>
I am a most ridiculous man<br>
<br>
And Natasha is in town<br>
I hear she is more beautiful than ever<br>
How I envy you and your happiness<br>
<br>
Here at home<br>
I drink and read and drink and read and drink<br>
And I fill my mind with rot<br>
While my heart is empty<br>
And I've been studying the Cabal<br>
And I've calculated the number of the beast<br>
It is Napoleon<br>
I will kill him one day<br>
He is not a great man<br>
None of us are great men<br>
We are just caught in the wave of history<br>
Nothing matters<br>
Everything matters<br>
It's all the same<br>
If only I could not see it,<br>
This dreadful, terrible it<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters<br>
We write letters<br>
We put down in writing<br>
What is happening in our minds<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Dear Andrey -<br>
<br>
What more can I write<br>
After all that has happened?<br>
What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?<br>
Must I break it off?<br>
These terrible questions<br>
<br>
NATASHA & PIERRE<br>
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror<br>
No visions of the future<br>
So lost and alone<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And what of Princess Mary<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
Dear Natasha<br>
I am in deep despair at the misunderstanding there is between us<br>
Whatever my father's feelings might be<br>
I beg you to believe that I cannot help loving you<br>
He's a tired old man and must be forgiven<br>
Please, come see us again<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Dear Princess Mary -<br>
<br>
Oh what am I to write!<br>
How do I choose<br>
What do I do<br>
I shall never be happy again<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
These terrible questions<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
I'm so alone here<br>
<br>
NATASHA & PIERRE<br>
So alone in here<br>
<br>
MARY<br>
And I see nothing<br>
<br>
NATASHA, PIERRE & MARY<br>
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror<br>
No visions of the future<br>
So lost and alone<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters<br>
We write letters<br>
We put down in writing<br>
What is happening in our minds<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Dear Natalie<br>
A love letter<br>
A love letter<br>
A love letter<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
A letter from him, from the man that I love<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
A letter which I composed<br>
<br>
ALL<br>
A love letter<br>
A love letter...<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
I must love you or die<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
If you love me say yes<br>
And I will come and steal you away<br>
Steal you out of the dark<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
I want nothing more<br>
<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
I must love you or die<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
If you love me say yes<br>
And I will come and steal you away<br>
Steal you out of the dark<br>
Natalie Natalie Natalie<br>
I want nothing more<br>
<br>
Just say yes<br>
Just say yes<br>
Just say yes<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Yes, yes, I love him!<br>
How else could I have his letter in my hand?<br>
I read it twenty times<br>
Thirty times, forty times!<br>
Each and every word<br>
I love him, I love him<br>
<br>
(Natasha sleeps. Sonya arrives and reads Anatole's letter.)<br>
<br>
## Sonya & Natasha
<br>
SONYA<br>
How was it I noticed nothing?<br>
How could it go so far?<br>
It can't be that she loves him<br>
It can't be<br>
Natasha<br>
<br>
(Natasha awakes and sees Sonya)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Sonya, you're back<br>
And with the tender resolve that often comes at the moment of awakening<br>
I embraced my friend<br>
But noticing Sonya's look of embarrassment<br>
My face expressed confusion<br>
And suspicion<br>
<br>
Sonya, you've read the letter?<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh Sonya, I'm glad,<br>
I can't hide it any longer!<br>
Now you know, we love one another!<br>
Oh Sonya, he writes, he writes<br>
He writes, he writes, he writes<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
And Andrey?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!<br>
You don't know what love is<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
But Natasha, can that all be over?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I do not grasp the question<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Are you refusing Prince Andrey?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Oh, you don't understand anything!<br>
Don't talk nonsense, just listen<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
But I can't believe it, I don\'t understand<br>
How you loved one man a whole year<br>
And suddenly -<br>
You've only known him three days!<br>
Natasha, you're joking!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Three days?<br>
It seems to me I've loved him a hundred years<br>
It seems to me that I've never loved anyone before<br>
Sonya, wait a bit, sit here<br>
<br>
I had heard that it happens like this<br>
And you must have heard it too<br>
But it's only now<br>
That I feel such love<br>
It's not the same as before<br>
He's my master and I am his slave<br>
What can I do?<br>
Sonya, what can I do?<br>
I'm so happy<br>
And so frightened<br>
Why can't you understand?<br>
I love him!<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Then I won't let it come to that, I shall tell!<br>
Bursting into tears<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
What do you mean?<br>
For God's sake, if you tell, you are my enemy!<br>
You want me to be miserable<br>
You want to tear us apart<br>
For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me<br>
I have confided in you<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
What has happened between you?<br>
What has he said to you?<br>
Why doesn't he come to the house and openly ask for you hand?<br>
Why this secrecy?<br>
Have you thought what his secret reasons may be?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I don't know what the reasons are<br>
But there must be reasons!<br>
Sonya, one can't doubt him!<br>
One can't, one can't! Don't you understand?<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Does he love you?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Does he love me?<br>
Why, you've read his letter, you've seen him<br>
I can't live without him<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Natasha, think of our family<br>
And think of Prince Andrey<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Andrey said I was free to refuse him<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
But you haven't refused him, or have you?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Perhaps I have<br>
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonsky<br>
Would you think so badly of me?<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
I won't succumb to your tender tone Natasha<br>
I don't trust him, Natasha!<br>
I'm afraid for you, Natasha!<br>
Afraid you are going to your ruin<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Then I'll go to my ruin, yes I will, as soon as possible!<br>
But it's not your business!<br>
It won't be you, it'll be me, who'll suffer<br>
Leave me alone, yes leave me alone!<br>
I hate you Sonya!<br>
I hate you Sonya!<br>
I hate you, I hate you!<br>
You're my enemy forever!<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
I burst into sobs<br>
<br>
(Natasha runs out of the room)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And without a moment's reflection<br>
I wrote the answer to Princess Mary<br>
I'd been unable to write all morning<br>
<br>
All our misunderstandings are at an end<br>
Forget everything and forgive me<br>
But I can't be Andrey's wife<br>
<br>
## Sonya Alone
<br>
SONYA:<br>
Hard as it is In the coming days<br>
I watch my friend in her strange unnatural state<br>
Don’t let her out of my sight<br>
She trails off Stares at nothing Laughs at random and the letters come<br>
<br>
She waits at the window And I listen at the door<br>
<br>
Until one day I see by the sad look on her face<br>
That there is a dreadful plan in her heart<br>
<br>
I know you are capable of anything I know you so well my friend<br>
I know you might just run away What am I to do?<br>
<br>
Who do I ask for help?<br>
Is it all on me? Is it all on me?<br>
<br>
I will stand in the dark for you<br>
I will hold you back by force<br>
I will stand here right outside your door<br>
I won’t see you disgraced<br>
I will protect your name and your heart<br>
Because I miss my friend<br>
<br>
I know you’ve forgotten me<br>
I know you so well my friend<br>
I know you might just throw yourself over<br>
But I won’t let you I won’t let you It’s all on me<br>
<br>
I remember this family I remember your kindness<br>
And if I never sleep again<br>
<br>
I will stand in the dark for you<br>
I will hold you back by force<br>
I will stand here right outside your door<br>
I won’t see you disgraced<br>
I will protect your name and your heart<br>
Because I miss my friend Because<br>
I miss my friend Because I miss you, my friend<br>
<br>
## Preparations
<br>
(Pierre runs into Anatole on the street. Pierre is drunk, Anatole in a hurry.)<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Ah, Anatole! Where are you off too?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Pierre, good man,<br>
Tonight I go away, on an adventure<br>
You'll not be seeing me for some time<br>
I've found a new pleasure<br>
And I'm taking her away<br>
I'll send you a letter from Poland<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Ha! An elopement!<br>
Fool, you are married already!<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Don't talk to me of that!<br>
I will not deprive myself of this one!<br>
Tonight! I take her tonight!<br>
Lend me fifty rubles?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Ah, that's a true sage<br>
Living in the moment<br>
What I wouldn't give to be like him!<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
The plan for Natalie Rostova's abduction<br>
Had all been arranged and the preparations made<br>
On the day that Sonya decided to save her<br>
That was the day that the game was to be played<br>
Natasha was to be on her back porch at ten<br>
Anatole and his troika would scoop her up and then<br>
They'd ride forty miles to the village of Kamenka,<br>
Where an unfrocked priest was to make 'em get wed<br>
Then back into the troika off they'd go<br>
Take the Poland highroad to the wedding bed<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Passports, horses, ten thousand rubles<br>
I have taken from my sister<br>
And another ten thousand raised with Dolokhov's help<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
We were gathered in my study drinking up some tea<br>
Just Anatole the two wedding witnesses and me<br>
An abacus and paper money strewn on the desk<br>
Persian rugs and bearskins hanging grotesque<br>
Anatole was walking with his uniform unbuttoned<br>
Walking to and fro<br>
To and fro<br>
To and fro<br>
<br>
ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV<br>
To and fro<br>
To and fro<br>
To and fro<br>
To and fro<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Now wait!<br>
You better<br>
Just<br>
Give it up now<br>
Why dontcha<br>
While there's still time!<br>
You'd really better drop it all<br>
Give it up now!<br>
While there's still time!<br>
Do you know?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
What, teasing again?<br>
Fool don't talk nonsense!<br>
Go to the devil! Eh?<br>
Really this is no time for your stupid jokes<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
I am not joking, I am talking sense<br>
This is serious business, a dangerous business<br>
Come here, come here, come here Anatole!<br>
Why would I joke about it?<br>
Me of all people<br>
Who found the priest, raised the money,<br>
Got the passports, got the horses?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
And well I think you for it<br>
Do you think I am not grateful?<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
And now you'll carry her away but will they let it stop there?<br>
You haven't thought this through or do you just don't care?<br>
Now listen to me tell it to you one last time<br>
They will take you to the court and convict you for your crime<br>
Already married and you're playing with a little girl<br>
Don't you know, don't you think, don't you know?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Nonsense, nonsense!<br>
I'm scowling and grimacing<br>
Didn't I explain it to you, didn't I, what?<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
And here Anatole,<br>
With the stubborn attachment small-minded people have<br>
For conclusions they've worked out for themselves<br>
Repeated his argument to me for the hundredth time<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
If this marriage isn't valid<br>
Then I'm off the hook<br>
But if it is valid, it really doesn't matter!<br>
No one abroad is gonna know a thing about it<br>
Isn't that so now don't you know?<br>
Don't talk to me, don't don't what what<br>
Ah go to hell now!<br>
I'm a-clutching my hair<br>
It's the very devil!<br>
Here, feel how it beats!<br>
<br>
(He pressed Dolokhov's hand to his heart.<br>
A light comes up on Natasha across the room.)<br>
<br>
Ah mon cher, mon cher<br>
Quel pied, quel regard!<br>
What a foot she has, what a glance!<br>
A goddess!<br>
<br>
And my handsome lips<br>
Mutter something tender to myself<br>
<br>
It's time!<br>
It's time!<br>
Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!<br>
The driver is here<br>
The driver is here<br>
Balaga is here!<br>

Let's go! Let's go!<br>
<br>
(They start to leave.)<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
No, wait, wait, wait!<br>
Shut the door!<br>
First we have to sit down!<br>
That's the way<br>
<br>
It's a Russian custom<br>
<br>
(They shut the door and all sit down for a moment.)<br>
<br>
All right<br>
<br>
(They start to leave)<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Wait, wait, wait!<br>
Where's the fur cloak?<br>
<br>
I have heard what elopements are like<br>
She'll rush out more dead than alive<br>
Just in the things she's wearing<br>
If you delay at all, there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mama'<br>
And she's frozen in a minute and must go back<br>
But you wrap the fur cloak round her<br>
And you carry her to the sleigh<br>

DOLOKHOV<br>
When they reached the gate Dolokhov whistled<br>
The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out<br>
<br>
MAIDSERVANT<br>
Come in through the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out directly<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Dolokhov stayed by the gate<br>
Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard<br>
Turned the corner, ran up to the porch<br>
<br>
(Anatole is stopped by Marya D.)<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
You will not enter my house, scoundrel!<br>
<br>
DOLOKHOV<br>
Anatole, come back!<br>
Betrayed! Betrayed!<br>
Betrayed, Anatole!<br>
Come back!<br>
Betrayed! Betrayed! Betrayed!<br>
<br>
(Dolokhov rushes in and rescues Anatole. They flee.)<br>
<br>
<br>
## In My House
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
You shameless good-for-nothing!<br>
You vile, shameless girl!<br>
In my house!<br>
In my house!<br>
A nice girl! Very nice!<br>
<br>
You dirty nasty wench of a thing<br>
Now don't you say one word<br>
In my house!<br>
In my house!<br>
Horrid girl, hussy!<br>
<br>
It's lucky for him he escaped, but I'll find him!<br>
Now you listen to me when I speak to you!<br>
Now you listen to me when I speak to you!<br>
In my house!<br>
In my house!<br>
Do you hear what I am saying or not?<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Natasha's whole body shook<br>
With noiseless, convulsive sobs<br>
Marya touched her hand to her face<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Don' touch me!<br>
Let me be! What is it to me? I shall die!<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
What are we to tell your father? Eh?<br>
In my house!<br>
In my house!<br>
What are we to tell Prince Andrey? Eh?<br>
Oh what do we tell your betrothed?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
I have no betrothed, I have refused him!<br>
<br>
SONYA<br>
Natasha, come here, kiss me<br>
Press your wet face to mine<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Don't touch me!<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Why didn't he come to the house,<br>
Why didn't he openly ask for your hand?<br>
You were not kept under lock and key!<br>
Carrying you off like some gypsy girl!<br>
And if he had carried you off,<br>
Don't you think your father would have found him?<br>
Your father, I know him,<br>
He will challenge him to a duel and what then?<br>
Will that be all right? Eh?<br>
He's a scoundrel, he's a wretch! That's a fact!<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
He is better than any of you I say<br>
He is better than any of you I say<br>
Why did you interfere! Oh God, what is it all?!<br>
What is it?<br>
Who are you to tell me anything?<br>
Sonya, why?<br>
Go away!<br>
Everyone, go away!<br>
<br>
Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out<br>
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!<br>
And she threw herself down on the sofa<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Natasha!<br>
Natalya...<br>
<br>
I put a pillow under her head<br>
Covered her with two quilts<br>
Brought her a glass of lime-flower water<br>
But Natasha did not respond<br>
Well, let her sleep<br>
Let her sleep<br>
<br>
(Marya D. leaves)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
But Natasha was not asleep<br>
Her face was pale<br>
Her eyes wide open<br>
All that night she did not sleep or weep<br>
She sat at the window<br>
Waiting for him<br>
<br>
## A Call to Pierre
<br>
(A servant hands a letter to Pierre)<br>
<br>
SERVANT<br>
A letter from Marya Dmitryevna asking you to come and visit her<br>
On a matter of great importance<br>
Relating to Andrey Bolkonsky and his betrothed<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
What?<br>
What can they want with me?<br>
<br>
(He arrives at Marya D.'s)<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Pierre, old friend I'm sorry it's late<br>
I'm sorry I haven't seen you about<br>
Where have you been?<br>
Where have you been?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
I have been studying<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Pierre old friend we need your help<br>
Pierre old friend the family name<br>
We need your help<br>
We need your help<br>
There's ruin at the door<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Marya?<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Natasha has let down the family<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
What?<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Natasha has broken with Andrey<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
What?<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Natasha has tried to elope<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
What?<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Natasha and Antole Kuragin!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
What?<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
We need your help<br>
We need your help<br>
There's ruin at the door<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Natasha, that charming girl?<br>
I can't believe my ears<br>
So I am not the only man<br>
Tied to a bad woman<br>
And Anatole, that stupid child<br>
They'll lock him up for years<br>
For Anatole is a married man!<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Married? He's married?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Yes<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
Oh wait till I tell her<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Poor Andrey<br>
<br>
MARYA D.<br>
And when Andrey comes home<br>
He will challenge Anatole to a duel<br>
And get himself killed<br>
And all will be ruined<br>
<br>
You must go see your brother-in-law<br>
And tell him that he must leave Moscow<br>
And not dare to let me set my eyes on him again<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
At once<br>
<br>
## Find Anatole
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
The blood rushes to my heart<br>
It's difficult to breathe<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
Not at the ice hills<br>
Not at the gypsies'<br>
Not at Komoneno's<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
Anatole, find Anatole<br>
To the Club<br>
<br>
And at the Club all is going on as usual<br>
The members eat their dinners<br>
And gossip in small groups<br>
<br>
PIERRE & CHORUS<br>
Have I heard of Kuragin's abduction?<br>
Is it true Natasha is ruined?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Nonsense, nonsense<br>
Nothing has happened<br>
Everything is fine<br>
<br>
(Pierre's house)<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Natasha<br>
Natasha<br>
It is essential that I see Natasha<br>
How can I see her?<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Anatole, come Anatole<br>
Anatole, hush Anatole<br>
<br>
(Marya D.'s house)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
What? What?<br>
I don't believe that he is married<br>
I don't believe you<br>
And I stare like a hunted wounded animal<br>
He can't be married!<br>
<br>
(Pierre's house)<br>
<br>
SERVANT (to Pierre)<br>
Good evening sir<br>
Prince Anatole is in the drawing room with the Countess<br>
<br>
HELENE<br>
Ah, Pierre<br>
Sweet husband<br>
You don't know what a plight our Anatole has had<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Be quiet<br>
I will not greet you<br>
At this moment you are more repulsive to me than ever<br>
<br>
Anatole, come Anatole<br>
Anatole, must speak to you<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Anatole followed with his usual jaunty step<br>
But his face betrayed anxiety<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him<br>
<br>
## Pierre & Anatole
<br>
(During this scene, Natasha prepares to poison herself)<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
You promised Countless Rostova to marry her<br>
And were about to elope, is that so?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Mon cher<br>
I don't consider myself bound<br>
To answer questions put to me in that tone<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
My face, already pale<br>
Becomes distorted by fury<br>
I seize you by the collar with my big big hands<br>
And I shake you from side to side<br>
Until your face shows a sufficient degree of terror<br>
When I tell you I must talk to you!<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Come now, this is stupid!<br>
What what don't don't!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
You're a scoundrel and a blackguard<br>
And I don't know what deprives me of the pleasure<br>
Of smashing your head in with this!<br>
<br>
(He takes a heavy paperweight and lifts it threateningly,<br>
But at once puts it back in its place)<br>
<br>
Did you promise to marry her?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
I didn't think of it. I never promised, because -<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Have you any letters of hers?<br>
Any letters?<br>
<br>
I shan't be violent, don't be afraid<br>
<br>
(Anatole hands Pierre a pack of letters)<br>
<br>
First, the letters<br>
Second, tomorrow you must get out of Moscow<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
But how can I?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Third<br>
You must never breathe a word of what has happened between you and the Countess<br>
Now I know I can't prevent your doing so<br>
But if you have a spark of conscience<br>
<br>
Pierre paces the room several times in silence<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Anatole sits at a table frowning and biting his lips<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
After all, you must understand<br>
That besides your pleasure<br>
There is such a thing as other people, and their happiness and peace<br>
And that you are ruining a whole life<br>
For the sake of amusing yourself!<br>
Amuse yourself with women like my wife<br>
With them you're within your rights<br>
But to promise a young girl to marry her<br>
To deceive, to kidnap<br>
Why don't you understand that that's as cruel as beating an old man or a child?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Well I don't know about that, eh?<br>
I don't know that and I don't want to<br>
But you have used such words to me<br>
'Scoundrel' and so on<br>
Which as a man of honor I will not allow anyone to use<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Is it satisfaction you want?<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
You could at least take back your words, eh?<br>
If you want me to do as you wish?<br>
<br>
(Natasha drinks the poison)<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Fine I take them back, I take them back!<br>
And I ask you to forgive me<br>
And if you require money for your journey -<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Anatole smiled<br>
The reflection of that base and cringing smile<br>
Which Pierre knew so well in his wife<br>
Revolted him<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Oh, vile and heartless brood!<br>
<br>
ANATOLE<br>
Next day Anatole left<br>
For Petersburg!<br>
<br>
## Natasha Very Ill
<br>
SONYA<br>
Natasha very ill<br>
The whole house<br>
A state of alarm and commotion<br>
Natasha very ill<br>
Having poisoned herself<br>
With a bit of arsenic<br>
She woke me in the middle of the night<br>
And told me what she had done<br>
And the doctors<br>
And the antidotes<br>
And now she is out of danger<br>
But still so weak<br>
And Andrey is to return<br>
We wait with dread<br>
<br>
## Pierre & Andrey
<br>
(Pierre visits Andrey)<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
Well, how are you?<br>
Still getting stouter?<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
There's a new wrinkle<br>
On your forehead old friend<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
It's good to see you<br>
It's been way too long<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
My friend, you are in need<br>
Your face is gloomy<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
No, I am well<br>
There's a war going on<br>
<br>
Forgive me for troubling you;<br>
I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova<br>
and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand,<br>
or something of that kind<br>
<br>
Here are her letters<br>
Please give them to the Countess<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Natasha is ill<br>
She has been at death's door<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
I much regret her illness<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
And he smiled like his father<br>
Coldly, maliciously<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
Well, it doesn't matter<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
You told me once<br>
A fallen woman should be forgiven<br>
<br>
ANDREY<br>
But I didn't say that I could forgive<br>
I can't<br>
<br>
Yes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?<br>
Yes, that would be very noble<br>
But I can't be that man<br>
If you wish to be my friend<br>
Never speak of that again<br>
<br>
Well, goodbye<br>
<br>
(Pierre takes the letters to Natasha)<br>
<br>
## Pierre & Natasha
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Natasha was standing<br>
In the middle of the drawing room<br>
With a pale yet steady face<br>
When I appeared in the doorway<br>
She grew flustered and I hurried to her<br>
I thought that she would give me her hand<br>
But instead she stopped<br>
Breathing heavily<br>
Her thin arms hanging lifelessly<br>
Just in the very pose<br>
She used to stand in as a young girl<br>
When she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing<br>
But the look on her face was quite different<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Peter Kirilovich -<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Pierre<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Prince Bolkonsky was your friend -<br>
He is your friend<br>
He once told me that I should turn to you<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but he didn't speak<br>
Till then he had reproached her, and tried to despise her<br>
But now he felt such pity for her<br>
That there was no room in his soul for reproach<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
He is here now<br>
Tell him to – tell him to forgive me<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Yes, I will tell him to forgive you<br>
But, he gave me your letters-<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
No, I know that all is over<br>
I know that it never can be<br>
But still I'm tormented by the wrongs I've done him<br>
Tell him that I beg him to forgive, forgive<br>
Forgive me for everything<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Yes I will tell him, tell him everything<br>
But-<br>
But I should like to know one thing<br>
Did you love-<br>
Did you love that bad man?<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Don't call him bad<br>
But I don't know, I don't know at all<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
She began to cry<br>
And a greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love overflowed Pierre's heart<br>
He felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles<br>
And he hoped that no one would see<br>
<br>
We won't speak of it anymore<br>
We won't speak of it, my dear<br>
But one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend<br>
And if you ever need help, or simply to open your heart to someone<br>
Not now, but your mind is clear<br>
Think of me-<br>
<br>
Pierre grew confused<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Don't speak to me like that<br>
I am not worth it!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Stop, stop, stop!<br>
<br>
You have your whole life before you-<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
Before me? No, all is over for me!<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
All over?<br>
<br>
(Music stops)<br>
<br>
If I were not myself,<br>
But the brightest, handsomest,<br>
Best man on earth,<br>
And if I were free-<br>
I would get down on my knees this minute<br>
And ask you for your hand<br>
And for your love.<br>
<br>
(Music resumes)<br>
<br>
NATASHA<br>
And for the first time in many days<br>
I weep tears of gratitude<br>
Tears of tenderness<br>
Tears of thanks<br>
And glancing at Pierre<br>
O Pierre<br>
I leave the room smiling<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
And restraining tears of tenderness<br>
Tears of joy that choke me<br>
I throw my fur coat on my shoulders<br>
Unable to find the sleeves<br>
<br>
Outside, my great broad chest<br>
Breathes in deep the air with joy<br>
Despite the ten degrees of frost<br>
<br>
And I get my sleigh<br>
<br>
## The Great Comet of 1812
<br>
PIERRE<br>
Where to now?<br>
Where can I go now?<br>
Not to the Club<br>
Not to pay calls<br>
<br>
Mankind seems so pitiful<br>
So poor<br>
Compared to that softened, grateful, last glance<br>
She gave me through her tears<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
It was clear and cold<br>
About the dirty streets<br>
Above the black roofs<br>
Stretched the dark starry sky<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
This vast firmament<br>
Open to my eyes<br>
Wet with tears<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
And there in the middle<br>
Above Prechistensky Boulevard<br>
Surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars<br>
Shines the Great Comet of 1812<br>
The Brilliant Comet of 1812<br>
<br>
PIERRE<br>
The comet said to portend<br>
Untold horrors<br>
And the end of the world<br>
<br>
But for me<br>
The comet brings no fear<br>
No, I gaze joyfully<br>
<br>
And this bright star<br>
Having traced its parabola<br>
With inexpressible speed<br>
Through immeasurable space<br>
Seems suddenly<br>
To have stopped<br>
Like an arrow piercing the earth<br>
Stopped for me<br>
<br>
It seems to me<br>
That this comet<br>
Feels me<br>
Feels my softened and uplifted soul<br>
And my newly melted heart<br>
Now blossoming<br>
Into a new life<br>
<br>
