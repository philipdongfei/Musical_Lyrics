# Avenue Q

## SYNOPSIS

### Act I

Princeton, a recent college graduate, is anxious to discover his purpose in life; but first, he must find an apartment and a job, with no work experience and an English degree ("What Do You Do with a B.A. in English? Lyrics"). Beginning his search on Avenue A, he finally finds an affordable apartment on Avenue Q. His new neighbors are Kate Monster, a kindergarten teaching assistant; Rod, an anal-retentive Republican banker; Nicky, Rod's slacker roommate; Brian, an aspiring comedian recently laid off from his day job; Christmas Eve, Brian's Japanese fiancée and a therapist with no clients; Trekkie Monster, a surly recluse who surfs the Internet all day in search of porn; and Gary Coleman, the building superintendent. Arguments ensue over whose life sucks the most ("It Sucks to Be Me Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
Nicky, who is straight, suspects that Rod is gay, and assures Rod it is okay with him if he is; but Rod insists he is not ("If You Were Gay Lyrics"). Princeton finds a lucky penny and longs to discover his purpose in life ("Purpose Lyrics"). Kate dreams of starting a "Monstersori" school for young "people of fur". Princeton innocently asks Kate if she and Trekkie are related, since they are both monsters, but Kate angrily pronounces his assumption racist. Princeton, taken aback, counters that Kate's Monstersori School would discriminate against non-monsters. They and the neighbors agree that racism is an adult reality ("Everyone's a Little Bit Racist Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
Princeton receives money from his parents, and the Bad Idea Bears, two charming troublemakers, convince him to spend it on beer. Kate's boss, Mrs. Thistletwat, assigns Kate to teach the next morning's kindergarten class, her first solo teaching opportunity. She decides that her lesson will be about the Internet and all its educational attributes, but Trekkie Monster and the neighbors explain another reality of adulthood: Lots of adults—even "normal people"—use it to find pornography ("The Internet is for Porn Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
Princeton gives Kate a mixtape. His song selections are puzzling, making her wonder what message he is trying to send, but eventually, she decides that he must like her ("Mixtape Lyrics"). Sure enough, he invites her on a date to the Around the Clock Café. Brian, the café's MC, does his raunchy stand-up act ("I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today Lyrics"). He then introduces Lucy the Slut, a skanky chanteuse who wows the guys, especially Princeton, with a seductive cabaret number ("Special Lyrics"). The Bad Idea Bears suggest that Kate and Princeton order some "harmless" Long Island Iced Teas, and once Kate is totally inebriated, that Princeton takes her home to bed.<br><br>
<br>
Kate and Princeton have enthusiastic, high-decibel sex. Gary fields angry calls from other tenants but refuses to intercede ("You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You're Makin' Love Lyrics"). Meanwhile, Rod hears Nicky say, "I love you, Rod," in his sleep, and is jubilant—but eventually realises it was he who was dreaming. Kate and Princeton profess their mutual love, and Princeton gives Kate his lucky penny ("Fantasies Come True Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
The next morning, a hung-over Kate oversleeps and misses her teaching assignment. Mrs. Thistletwat berates her, and Kate angrily quits her job before she can be fired. Christmas Eve decides unilaterally that it is time she and Brian were married. At the wedding, Nicky blurts out his suspicion that Rod is gay. Rod, furious, insists he has a girlfriend named Alberta in Vancouver ("My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada Lyrics") and tells Nicky he is no longer welcome in their apartment.<br><br>
<br>
When Kate catches Christmas Eve's wedding bouquet, Princeton panics, confesses a fear of commitment, and asks Kate if they can just be friends. Kate retorts that she already has plenty of friends, and breaks off their relationship ("There's a Fine, Fine Line Lyrics").<br><br>

### Act II

A despondent Princeton has been holed up in his apartment after breaking up with Kate but is coaxed out by the neighbors ("There is Life Outside Your Apartment Lyrics"). Lucy is looking for a place to crash and seduces the rebounding Princeton. Kate is angry, but Christmas Eve explains that she would not be angry if she were not in love with him ("The More You Ruv Someone Lyrics"). Kate writes a note to Princeton suggesting that they rendezvous at the Empire State Building and leaves it with Lucy who promptly destroys it. A homeless Nicky laments his fate to Gary who confesses that he is deriving pleasure from Nicky's misfortune ("Schadenfreude Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
On the Empire State Building's viewing platform, Kate, thinking that Princeton has stood her up, throws his lucky penny away. A hundred stories below, Lucy, walking by on Fifth Avenue, is knocked unconscious by the penny. Kate and Princeton unsuccessfully try to work out their problems over Lucy's comatose body. Rod is too proud to accept Nicky's repeated apologies, despite clearly missing him, and tearfully consults Christmas Eve. Princeton, Kate, and Nicky dream of returning to happier times ("I Wish I Could Go Back to College Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
Princeton gives a still-homeless panhandling Nicky a quarter, and marvels at how fantastic he feels. Since thinking only about himself has gotten him nowhere, he decides to raise money to build Kate's Monstersori School. He solicits everyone, even breaking the fourth wall to shake down the audience, but results are disappointing ("The Money Song Lyrics"). Then Trekkie Monster, recalling his own traumatic school experiences, donates ten million dollars—and explains to the astonished cast, "In volatile market, only stable investment is porn!" ("School for Monsters/The Money Song (Reprise) Lyrics").<br><br>
<br>
Kate joyfully opens her new school. Brian lands a consulting job, and Christmas Eve finally has a paying client (Rod), so the newlyweds move to a better neighborhood. Rod finally comes out, to no one's particular surprise, and takes Nicky back in. Nicky finds Rod a boyfriend—Ricky, a muscle-bound hunk who otherwise looks and sounds exactly like Nicky. The Bad Idea Bears discover Scientology. Lucy, recovered from her head injury, becomes a born-again Christian and takes a vow of chastity. Kate and Princeton agree to give their relationship another go ("There's a Fine, Fine Line (Reprise)").<br><br>
<br>
A new college graduate inquires about the vacancy in the building, ("What Do You Do with a BA in English (Reprise)") and Princeton has an epiphany: maybe his purpose is to put everything he learned into a Broadway musical. Everybody, especially the new guy, immediately ridicules him. The cast reminds Princeton that, in the real world, many people never find their purpose, but life goes on, and everything—both good and bad—is "only for now." ("For Now").<br><br>

## The Avenue Q Theme  

COMPANY<br>
The sun is shining,<br>
It's a lovely day,<br>
A perfect morning<br>
For a kid to play,<br>
But you're got lots<br>
Of bills to pay -<br>
What can you do?<br>
<br>
Your work real hard<br>
And the pay's real low<br>
And ev'ry hour<br>
Goes oh, so slow<br>
And at the end of the day<br>
There's no where to go<br>
But home to Avenue Q!<br>
You live on Avenue Q!<br>
You're friends do too.<br>
You are twenty-two<br>
And you live on Avenue Q!<br>
You live on Avenue Q<br>
You live on Avenue Q!<br>

## What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?  

What do you do with a B.A. in English,<br>
What is my life going to be?<br>
Four years of college and plenty of knowledge,<br>
Have earned me this useless degree.<br>
<br>
I can't pay the bills yet,<br>
'Cause I have no skills yet,<br>

But somehow I can't shake,<br>
The feeling I might make,<br>
A difference,<br>
To the human race.<br>

## If You Were Gay  

ROD<br>
Aah, an afternoon alone with<br>
My favorite book, "Broadway<br>
Musicals of the 1940s."<br>
No roommate to bother me.<br>
How could it get any better than this?<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
Oh,hi Rod!<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
Hi Nicky.<br>
<br>

Hey Rod, you'll never<br>
Guess what happened to<br>
Me on the subway this morning.<br>
This guy was smiling at me and talking to me<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
That's very interesting.<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
He was being real friendly,<br>
And I think he was coming on to me.<br>
I think he might've thought I was gay!<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
Ahem, so, uh, why are you telling me this?<br>
Why should I care?<br>
I don't care.<br>
What did you have for lunch today?<br>

All defensive about it, Rod...<br>

What do I care about some gay guy you met, okay?<br>
I'm trying to read.<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it, Rod.<br>
I just think it's something we should be able to talk about.<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
I don't want to talk about it,<br>
Nicky! This conversation is over!!!<br>

NICKY<br>
Yeah, but...<br>

BECAUSE YOU SEE,<br>
IF IT WERE ME,<br>
I WOULD FEEL FREE<br>
TO SAY THAT I WAS GAY<br>

IF I TOLD YOU TODAY,<br>
"HEY! GUESS WHAT,<br>

(BUT I'M NOT GAY.)<br>
I'M HAPPY<br>
JUST BEING WITH YOU.<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
High Button Shoes, Pal Joey...<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
SO WHAT SHOULD IT<br>
MATTER TO ME<br>
WHAT YOU DO IN BED<br>
WITH GUYS?<br>

## Purpose  

Princeton<br>
Purpose,<br>
It's that little flame<br>
That lights a fire<br>
Under your ass.<br>
Purpose,<br>
It keeps you going strong<br>

Tank of gas.<br>
Everyone else has<br>
A purpose<br>

## Everyone's A Little Bit Racist  

Princeton:<br>
Say, Kate, can I ask you a question?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Sure!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, you know Trekkie Monster upstairs?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Uh huh.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, he's Trekkie Monster, and you're Kate Monster.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
You're both Monsters.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Yeah.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Are you two related?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
What?! Princeton, I'm surprised at you! I find that racist!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Oh, well, I'm sorry! I was just asking!<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Well, it's a touchy subject.<br>
No, not all Monsters are related.<br>
What are you trying say, huh?<br>
That we all look the same to you?<br>
Huh, huh, huh?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
No, no, no, not at all. I'm sorry,<br>
I guess that was a little racist.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
I should say so. You should be much more<br>
careful when you're talking about the<br>
sensitive subject of race.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, look who's talking!<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
What do you mean?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
What about that special Monster School you told me about?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
What about it?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Could someone like me go there?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
No, we don't want people like you-<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
You see?!<br>
<br>
You're a little bit racist.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Well, you're a little bit too.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
I guess we're both a little bit racist.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Admitting it is not an easy thing to do...<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
But I guess it's true.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Between me and you,<br>
I think<br>
<br>
Both:<br>
Everyone's a little bit racist<br>
Sometimes.<br>
Doesn't mean we go<br>
Around committing hate crimes.<br>
Look around and you will find<br>
No one's really color blind.<br>
Maybe it's a fact<br>
We all should face<br>
Everyone makes judgments<br>
Based on race.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Now not big judgments, like who to hire<br>
or who to buy a newspaper from -<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
No!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
No, just little judgments like thinking that Mexican<br>
busboys should learn to speak goddamn English!<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Right!<br>
<br>
Both:<br>
Everyone's a little bit racist<br>
Today.<br>
So, everyone's a little bit racist<br>
Okay!<br>
Ethinic jokes might be uncouth,<br>
But you laugh because<br>
They're based on truth.<br>
Don't take them as<br>
Personal attacks.<br>
Everyone enjoys them -<br>
So relax!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
All right, stop me if you've heard this one.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
There's a plan going down and there's only<br>
one paracute. And there's a rabbi, a priest...<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
And a black guy!<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Kate?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Uh...<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
You were telling a black joke!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, sure, Gary, but lots of people tell black jokes.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
I don't.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, of course you don't - you're black!<br>
But I bet you tell Polack jokes, right?<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Well, sure I do. Those stupid Polacks!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Now, don't you think that's a little racist?<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Well, damn, I guess you're right.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
You're a little bit racist.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Well, you're a little bit too.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
We're all a little bit racist.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
I think that I would<br>
Have to agree with you.<br>
<br>
Princeton/Kate Monster:<br>
We're glad you do.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
It's sad but true!<br>
Everyone's a little bit racist -<br>
<br>
All right!<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
All right!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
All right!<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
All right!<br>
Bigotry has never been<br>
Exclusively white<br>
<br>
All:<br>
If we all could just admit<br>
That we are racist a little bit,<br>
Even though we all know<br>
That it's wrong,<br>
Maybe it would help us<br>
Get along.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Oh, Christ do I feel good.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Now there was a fine upstanding black man!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Who?<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
But, Gary, Jesus was white.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
No, Jesus was black.<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
No, Jesus was white.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
No, I'm pretty sure that Jesus was black-<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Guys, guys...Jesus was Jewish!<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
Hey guys, what are you laughing about?<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Racism!<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
Cool.<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
BRIAN! Come back here!<br>
You take out lecycuraburs!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
What's that mean?<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
Um, recyclables.<br>
Hey, don't laugh at her!<br>
How many languages do you speak?<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Oh, come off it, Brian!<br>
Everyone's a little bit racist.<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
I'm not!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Oh no?<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
Nope!<br>
<br>
How many Oriental wives<br>
Have you got?<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
What? Brian!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Brian, buddy, where you been?<br>
The term is Asian-American!<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
I know you are no<br>
Intending to be<br>
But calling me Oriental -<br>
Offensive to me!<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
I'm sorry, honey, I love you.<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
And I love you.<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
But you're racist, too.<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
Yes, I know.<br>
The Jews have all<br>
The money<br>
And the whites have all<br>
The power.<br>
And I'm always in taxi-cab<br>
With driver who no shower!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Me too!<br>
<br>
Kate Monster:<br>
Me too!<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
I can't even get a taxi!<br>
<br>
All:<br>
Everyone's a little bit racist<br>
It's true.<br>
But everyone is just about<br>
As racist as you!<br>
If we all could just admit<br>
That we are racist a little bit,<br>
And everyone stopped being<br>
So PC<br>
Maybe we could live in -<br>
Harmony!<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>

LUCY:<br>
I can make you feel special<br>
When it sucks to be you.<br>
I can make you feel special<br>
For an hour or two.<br>
<br>
Your life's a routine that repeats each day.<br>
No one cares who you are or what you say.<br>
And sometimes you feel like you're nobody,<br>
But you can feel like somebody with me.<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
Wow!<br>
<br>
LUCY:<br>
Yeah, they're real.<br>
<br>
When we're together the earth will shake<br>
And the stars will fall into the sea.<br>
So come on, baby, let down your guard.<br>
When your date's in the bathroom,<br>
I'll slip you my card.<br>
I can tell just by looking that you've got it hard<br>
For me! For me!<br>
For me! For me!<br>
For me! For me!<br>
I can tell just by looking that you are especially hard for me!<br>
<br>

ROD<br>
Ugh, he's talking in his sleep again.<br>
NICKY<br>
No, I'll wear the purple shoes.  Hh, who painted the kitten?<br>

Ugh, maybe I should just shake him.<br>
NICKY<br>

ROD<br>

NICKY<br>
Take off your shirt<br>
ROD<br>
Oh Nicholas!  Have you been shy all this time?<br>
Have we been... hiding from each other?  I wonder...<br>
<br>
All those nights<br>
I'd lay in bed<br>
Thoughts of you<br>
Running through my head<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
I know, put my earmuffs on the cookie<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
But I never thought<br>
The things in my head<br>
Could really happen<br>
In my bed<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
You look like David Hasselhoff<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
All those years<br>
I missed the signs<br>
Couldn't read<br>
Between the lines<br>
<br>
Who'd have thought<br>
I would see the day<br>
Where I'd hear you say<br>
What I heard you say<br>
<br>
And now I find<br>
What was always in my mind was in your mind too<br>
Who knew?  Fantasies come true<br>
And now I see<br>
That what I always dreamed of was meant to be<br>
You and me and you, fantasies come true<br>
<br>
MUSICAL INTERLUDE<br>

You're amazing<br>
PRINCETON<br>
Heh, I want you to have this.<br>

It's from the year I was born, see?<br>
Who knows?  Maybe it'll bring you good luck.  It did for me.  I found you.<br>
<br>
I want you to know<br>
The time that we've spent<br>
How great it's been<br>
How much it's meant<br>
<br>
KATE<br>
Gosh, I don't know what to say<br>
I'm really glad you feel that way<br>

Cuz I'm afraid<br>
That I like you more<br>

When you want me I'm gonna be right there<br>

ROD                       KATE<br>
To care                  To care<br>
<br>
BOTH<br>
For you<br>
<br>
KATE<br>
That's what I'm gonna do<br>
<br>
ROD                        KATE<br>
And make your fantasies   Fantasies<br>
<br>
BOTH<br>
Come true<br>
<br>
ROD<br>
Fantasies come true<br>
<br>
NICKY<br>
Uh, hey Rod, buddy, you're talking in your sleep.<br>
ROD<br>
Oh, I thought you were talking in your sleep...<br>
NICKY<br>
No I just came to bed.  Heh, you're dreamin' is all.<br>
ROD<br>
Oh.<br>
NICKY<br>
Sounded like a nice dream, though.<br>
ROD<br>
Yes it was a nice dream.<br>
NICKY<br>
Goodnight!<br>
ROD<br>
Goodnight, Nicky.<br>

## My Girlfriend, Who Lives in Canada  

ROD<br>
Ohhhh...<br>
I wish you could meet my girlfriend,<br>
My girlfriend who lives in Canada.<br>
She couldn't be sweeter<br>
I wish you could meet her,<br>
My girlfriend who lives in Canada!<br>

Her name is Alberta<br>
She live in Vancouver<br>
She cooks like my mother<br>
And sucks like a Hoover.<br>

I e-mail her every single day<br>
Just to make sure that everything's okay.<br>
It's a pity she lives so far away, in Canada!<br>
<br>
Last week she was here, but she had the flu.<br>
Too bad<br>
'Cause I wanted to introduce her to you<br>
It's so sad<br>
There wasn't a thing that she could do<br>
But stay in bed with her legs up over her head!<br>
Oh!<br>
<br>
I wish you could meet my girlfriend,<br>
But you can't because she is in Canada.<br>
I love her, I miss her, I can't wait to kiss her,<br>
So soon I'll be off to Alberta!<br>
I mean Vancouver!<br>
Shit! Her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancou-<br>
<br>
She's my girlfriend!<br>
My wonderful girlfriend!<br>
Yes I have a girlfriend, who lives in Canada!!<br>
<br>
And I can't wait to eat her pussy again!<br>

## There's a Fine, Fine Line  

Kate Monster:<br>
There's a fine, fine line between a lover and a friend;<br>
There's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend;<br>
And you never know 'til you reach the top if it was worth the uphill climb.<br>
<br>
There's a fine, fine line between love<br>
And a waste of time.<br>
<br>
There's a fine, fine line between a fairy tale and a lie;<br>
And there's a fine, fine line between<br>
"You're wonderful" and "Goodbye."<br>
I guess if someone doesn't love you back it isn't such a crime,<br>
But there's a fine, fine line between love<br>
And a waste of your time.<br>
<br>
And I don't have the time to waste on you anymore.<br>
I don't think that you even know what you're looking for.<br>
For my own sanity, I've got to close the door<br>
And walk away...<br>
Oh...<br>
<br>
There's a fine, fine line between together and not<br>
And there's a fine, fine line between what you wanted and what you got.<br>
You gotta go after the things you want while you're still in your prime...<br>
<br>
There's a fine, fine line between love<br>
And a waste of time.<br>

## I Wish I Could Go Back to College  

KATE MONSTER:<br>
I wish I could go back to college.<br>
Life was so simple back then.<br>
<br>
NICKY:<br>
What would I give to go back<br>
And live in a dorm with a meal plan again!<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
I wish I could go back to college.<br>
In college you know who you are.<br>
You sit in the quad, and think, "Oh my God!<br>
I am totally gonna go far!"<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
How do I go back to college?<br>
I don't know who I am anymore!<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
I wanna go back to my room<br>
And find a message in dry-erase pen on the door!<br>
Ohhh...<br>
I wish I could just drop a class...<br>
<br>
NICKY:<br>
Or get into a play...<br>
<br>
KATE MONSTER:<br>
Or change my major...<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
Or fuck my T.A.<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
I need an academic advisor to point the way!<br>
We could be...<br>
Sitting in the computer lab,<br>
4 A.M. before the final paper is due,<br>
Cursing the world 'cause I didn't start sooner,<br>
And seeing the rest of the class there, too!<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
I wish I could go back to college!<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
How do I go back to college?!<br>
AHHHH...<br>
<br>
PRINCETON:<br>
I wish I had taken more pictures.<br>
<br>
NICKY:<br>
But if I were to go back to college,<br>
Think what a loser I'd be-<br>
I'd walk through the quad,<br>
And think "Oh my God..."<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
"These kids are so much younger than me."<br>

## The Money Song  

Nicky:<br>
Help the homeless!<br>
Help the homeless!<br>
Ooh! Hey Princeton!<br>
<br>
Give me a quarter!<br>
Here in my hat!<br>
Come on, Princeton!<br>
It’s as easy as that!<br>
Helping others brings you<br>
Closer to God.<br>
So give me a quarter...<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
I don’t have any change.<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Hmmm....okay.<br>
<br>
Give me a dollar.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
That’s not what I meant.<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Give me a five.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Are you kidding?<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
The more you give.<br>
The more you get.<br>
That’s being alive!<br>
All I’m asking you<br>
Is to do what<br>
Jesus Christ would do.<br>
He’d give me a quarter,<br>
Why don’t you?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
All right, all right, here you go.<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Ahh, thanks!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Take care.<br>
Whoa!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
What’s the matter?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
I feel generous!<br>
I feel compassionate!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
You do?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Yeah! I feel like a new person - a good person!<br>
Helping other people out makes you feel fantastic!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you-<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
All this time I’ve been running around thinking<br>
about me, me, me - and where has it gotten me!<br>
I’m gonna do something for someone else!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Me?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
No - Kate! I’m going to raise the money to build that<br>
stupid Monster School she’s always talking about!<br>
<br>
Give me your money!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
What?<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
I need it for Kate!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
I need it to eat!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Come on, Nicky!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Aww, get lost!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
It’ll make you feel great!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
So would a burger!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
When her dream comes true,<br>
It’ll all be partly<br>
Thanks to you<br>
So give me your money!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
I’d like to, but I can’t.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Give me your money!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
I’d like to, but I need it!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Give me your money!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
I’d like to, but I’m homeless!<br>
I can’t! I need it! I’m homeless!<br>
I can’t! I need it! I’m homeless!<br>
I can’t! I need it! I’m homeless!<br>
Okay, here you go.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Thank you!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Suddenly,<br>
I am feeling<br>
Closer to God.<br>
It’s time to stop begging<br>
It’s time to start giving!<br>
What can I give to Rod?<br>
<br>
Something he’ll like so much he’ll take me back.<br>
Ooh, I know! I’ll find him a boyfriend!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
That’s the spirit!<br>
<br>
Both:<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t help helping yourself!<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t help helping yourself!<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Hey boys, what’s the hat for?<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Ooh, we’re collecting money!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
It’s for Kate! We’re raising money to help build her dream school!<br>
<br>
Give us your money!<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
You’ll be glad that you did!<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
That’s just what my parents told me<br>
When I was a kid.<br>
<br>
Shit.<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
But giving feels so great...<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
And I bet it wouldn’t hurt<br>
Your chances with Kate.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Well, that too.<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
I’ll give you a dollar.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
You’re a gentleman<br>
And a scholar.<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>

<br>
Princeton:<br>

<br>
Nicky/Gary Coleman<br>
Give us the dough!<br>
<br>
Princeton/Nicky/Gary Coleman<br>
We’re raising money<br>
For a Monster School<br>
But we’ve got a ways to go.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Sounds like you’ve<br>
Got money to burn<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
And it’s not like money<br>
That you had to earn.<br>
<br>
Princeton/Nicky/Gary Coleman:<br>
So give us your money -<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
A monster school?<br>
<br>
Brian:<br>
Sounds like a good cause.<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
Give me your wallet.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Oh my gosh! I don’t know how to thank you guys.<br>
I mean, Kate will be so grateful!<br>
That kind of money is such a great start...<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Yeah, $15.<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
$15?<br>
<br>
Christmas Eve:<br>
Every little bit help.<br>
<br>
Nicky:<br>
Looks like we’re gonna have to ask MORE people!<br>
<br>
<br>
All:<br>
Hey!<br>
Give us your money!<br>
All that you’ve got!<br>
Just fork it on over...<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
Or some puppets<br>
Will get shot!<br>
<br>
Princeton:<br>
Hey!<br>
<br>
All:<br>
It’s time to pass the hat<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman:<br>
And there’s nothing you can do ‘bout that<br>
<br>
All:<br>
So give us your money!<br>
Give us your money!<br>
Give us your money!<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t help helping yourself!<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t help helping yourself!<br>
Every time you<br>
Do good deeds<br>
You’re also serving<br>
Your own needs.<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t help helping yourself!<br>
When you give<br>
To a worthy cause<br>
You’ll feel as jolly<br>
As Santa Clause.<br>
When you help others,<br>
You can’t<br>
Help<br>
Helping yourself!<br>
