# THE BOOK OF MORMON


## SYNOPSIS

### Act 1

Mormon missionaries of the LDS Church go door-to-door to attempt to convert people to Mormonism ("Hello Lyrics"). One of them, Elder Cunningham, is an insecure, overweight, irritating liar. Another, Elder Price, is a devout, enthusiastic, handsome, pompous, over-confident fellow. Price believes that if he prays enough, he will be sent to Orlando, Florida ("Two By Two Lyrics"); instead, both are sent together to Uganda, Africa ("You And Me (But Mostly Me) Lyrics").<br>
<br>
There, they see people living in appalling conditions of famine, poverty and AIDS, who are ruled by a despotic, murderous chieftain. The native Ugandans curse their existence (saying, "Fuck you, God!") ("Hasa Diga Eebowai Lyrics"). Several other missionaries already in the country have been unable to convert the locals to Mormonism. The Ugandans cope with their miserable lives by feigning happiness.<br>
<br>
Elder McKinley is one of the other missionaries who is sent to Africa along with Price and Cunningham. He laments his homosexual feelings, but reminds himself to "Turn It Off Lyrics" like a light switch. The others agree that their feelings must be hidden, at all costs.<br>
<br>
Price is certain that he can succeed where the other Mormon Elders have failed, teaching the Ugandans about Joseph Smith ("All-American Prophet Lyrics"). The Ugandans find him arrogant and are not impressed. Cunningham, unhappy with Price, finally takes the initiative ("I Am Here For You Lyrics"). The local leader's daughter, Nabulungi, wants Cunningham to take the whole village to "Sal Tlay Ka Siti Lyrics", where they can find fortune and avoid the horrors of rape, genital mutilation and murder. The villagers' needs are too much for Price, who decides to abandon his mission brother and request to be transferred to Orlando. Finding himself alone, Cunningham decides to "Man Up Lyrics" and take control.<br>
<br>

### Act 2

<br>
Cunningham lacks much knowledge of the Book of Mormon, but he makes up stories that combine what he knows of Mormon doctrine with bits and pieces of science fiction and other cultural ideas ("Making Things Up Again Lyrics"), many of them unsavory. While Cunningham preaches, Price reflects on the misdemeanors he committed in his childhood, including blaming things on his brother Jack. He is reminded of the nightmares he had, calling them "Spooky Mormon Hell Dream Lyrics". Because of this, Price decides to be optimistic about his stay in Uganda ("I Believe Lyrics").<br>
<br>
Cunningham concludes his preaching; the villagers are enchanted; they are baptized and accept Mormonism ("Baptize Me Lyrics"). They gain the confidence to resist the despot, who also finally converts. The villagers "honor [them] with the story of Joseph Smith, the American Moses" ("Joseph Smith American Moses Lyrics"). Seeing the Ugandans celebrate their faith, Price is astonished to learn that the importance of religion is not truth, but whether it helps people. Ironically, his faith, and that of the other missionaries, is revitalized, and they stay to help the village ("Tomorrow Is a Latter Day Lyrics").<br>

## Hasa Diga Eebowai  

<br>
MAFALA:<br>
In this part of Africa,<br>
We ALL have a saying- whenver something bad happens,<br>
we just throw our hands up to the sky and say HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai?<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times.<br>
There's war, poverty, famine...<br>
But having a saying makes it all seem better!<br>
<br>
There isn't enough food to eat!<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai!<br>
People are starving in the street!<br>
<br>
UGANDANS and MAFALA:<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai!<br>

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
DOes it mean no worries for the rest of our days?<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>
Kind of!<br>
<br>
We've had no rain in several days!<br>
<br>
UGANDANS:<br>
Hasa DIga Eebowai!<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>

<br>
UGANDANS:<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai!<br>

Many young girls here get<br>
Circumcised,<br>
Their clits get cut right off.<br>

UGANDANS:<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Am I saying it right?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Excuse me sir,<br>
But what EXACTLY does that phrase mean?<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>
Well, let's see... "Eebowai" means "God".<br>
And "Hasa Diga" means... "Fuck You".<br>
So I guess in English it would be "Fuck you, God!"<br>
<br>
UGANDANS:<br>
Hasa Diga Eebowai!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
WHAT?!<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>

ELDER PRICE:<br>
Excuse me, Sir, but you should really NOT be saying that.<br>
Things aren't always as bad as they seem!<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>
Oh really?  Well take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo.<br>
He got caught last week trying to RAPE a baby.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
What?!  Why?!<br>
<br>
MAFALA:<br>
Some people in his tribe believe having<br>
sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS.<br>
There aren't many virgins left,<br>
So some of them are turning to babies.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
But... that's horrible!<br>

## Turn It Off  

<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:<br>
I got a feeling,<br>
That you could be feeling,<br>
A whole lot better then you feel today<br>
You say you got a problem,<br>
well thats no problem,<br>
It's super easy not to feel that way!<br>
<br>
When you start to get confused because of thoughts in your head,<br>
Don't feel those feelings!<br>
Hold them in instead<br>
<br>
Turn it off, like a light switch<br>
just go click!<br>
It's a cool little Mormon trick!<br>
We do it all the time<br>
When your feeling certain feels that just don't feel right<br>
Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light<br>
and turn em off,<br>
Like a light switch just go bap!<br>
Really whats so hard about that?<br>
Turn it off! (Turn it off!)<br>
<br>
When I was young my dad,<br>
Would treat my mom real bad,<br>
every time the Utah Jazz would loose.<br>
He'd start a' drinking,<br>
and I'd start a thinking,<br>
How am I gonna keep my mom from getting abused?<br>
<br>
I'd see her all scared and my soul was dying,<br>
My dad would say to me, Now don't you dare start crying.<br>
<br>
Turn it off, (Like a light switch just go click!)<br>
(It\'s our nifty little Mormon trick!)<br>
Turn it off! (Turn. It. Off!)<br>
<br>
My Sister was a dancer, but she got cancer,<br>
My doctor said she still had two months more<br>
I thought she had time, so I got in line<br>
for the new I-phone at the apple store.<br>
<br>
She lay there dying with my father and mother<br>
Her very last words were "where is my brother?"<br>
<br>
(Turn it off!) Yeah!  (Bid those sad feelings a adieu!)<br>
The fear I might get cancer too,<br>
<br>
When I was in fifth grade, I had a friend Steve Blade,<br>
He and I were close as two friend could be<br>
One thing led to another, and soon I would discover,<br>
I was having really strange feelings for Steve<br>
<br>
I thought about us, on a deserted Island<br>
We'd swim naked in the sea, and then he'd try and...<br>
<br>
WOAH!  Turn if off, like a light switch,<br>
there its gone! (Good for you!)<br>
My hetero side just won!<br>
I'm all better now,<br>
Boys should be with girls thats heavenly fathers plan<br>
So if you ever feel you rather be with a man,<br>
Turn it off.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Well Elder McKinley, I think its ok that your having gay thoughts,<br>
just so long as you never act on them.<br>
<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:<br>
No, because then your just keeping it down,<br>
Like a dimmer switch on low, (On low!)<br>
Thinking nobody needs to know! (Uh oh!)<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
But that's not true!<br>
<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:<br>
Being gay is bad, but lying is worse,<br>
So just realize you have a curable curse,<br>
And turn it off!  (Turn it off, turn it off!)<br>
<br>
(Dance)<br>
<br>
Turn it off!<br>
<br>
Now how do you feel!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
The same<br>
<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:<br>
Then you only got yourself to blame,<br>
You didn't pretend hard enough,<br>
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes,<br>
and find the box thats gay and CRUSH IT!<br>
Ok?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
No, no, -I'm- not having gay thoughts<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Alright!  It worked!<br>
<br>
(Yay!)<br>
<br>
(Turn it off!)<br>
<br>
(Turn it off, Turn it off!)<br>
<br>
(Turn it off, turn it off like a light switch just go click click!<br>
What a cool little Mormon Trick! Trick trick!<br>
We do it all the time!)<br>
<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:<br>
When your feeling certain feelings that just dont seem right!<br>
Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light!<br>
Turn it off!  (Like a light switch, shut it off!)<br>
(Now he isn't gay anymore!)<br>
<br>
(Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...!)<br>
(Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...!)<br>
(Turn it...)<br>
<br>
ELDER MCKINLEY:  Turn it off!<br>

## I Am Here For You  

<br>
(Price and Cunningham)<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
I'd do anything for you.  I'm your best friend.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Well, alright then.  Let's get some sleep, huh?<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Yeah... So tired....<br>
<br>
Sleep now, little buddy,<br>
Throw your cares away.<br>
Nappy with a happy face,<br>
Tomorrow's a latter day.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
What are you doing?<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
I'm just trying to make you feel better!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
I feel fine.... But this is what I'm talking out Elder,<br>
Out focus needs to be on our work.<br>
Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be?<br>
The missionaries here have yet<br>
to baptize a SINGLE person to the chruch.<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here,<br>
then it woun'lt be so incredible when YOU did it, now would it?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
I guess.... I guess that's kind of true....<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Don't forget what you told me!  You are awesome!<br>
Together, we're gonna bring LOTS of Africans to the church!<br>
And my Dad will finally feel proud of me...<br>
Instead of just feeling "stuck" with me....<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
You know what, Elder?<br>
I think your Dad's got plenty to be proud of already.<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Really?!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Yeah!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Evening star shines brightly,<br>
God makes like anew!<br>
Tomorrow is a latter day,<br>
And I am here for you.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
I am here for you, too.<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM and ELDER PRICE:<br>
We are here<br>
For us.<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Goodnight, best friend!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Goodnight, pal.<br>
<br>

## All American Prophet  

<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
You all know the Bible<br>
Is made of Testaments old and new.<br>
You've been told it's just those two parts,<br>
Or only one, if you're a Jew.<br>
But what if I were to tell you<br>
There's a FRESH third part out there?<br>
That was found by a HIP new prophet<br>
Who had a little...<br>
Donny Osmond flair?<br>
<br>
Have you heard of the<br>
All-American Prophet?<br>
The blonde-haired,<br>
Blue-eyed voice of God!<br>
He didn't come from the Middle East<br>
Like those other holy men!<br>
No, God's favorite prophet was...<br>
All-American!<br>
<br>
I'm gonna take you back to Biblical times; 1823.<br>
An American man named Joe livin' on a farm in the holy land of Rochester, New York!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
You mean the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
That's right, that young man spoke to God!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
He spoke to God?!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
And God said:<br>
"Joe, people really need to know<br>
That the Bible isn't two parts!<br>
There's a part THREE to<br>
The Bible, Joe!  And I, God<br>
Have anointed you to dig up this<br>
Part three that is buried by the<br>
Tree on the hill in your backyard!"<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Wow, God says go to you backyard and start digging, that makes PERFECT SENSE!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Joseph Smith went up to that hill,<br>
And dug where he was told.<br>
And deep in the ground, Joseph found<br>
Shining plates of gold!<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
What are these golden plates?<br>
Who buried them here, and why?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Then appeared an angel!<br>
His name was Moroni!<br>
<br>
MORONI:<br>
I am Moroni....<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
The All-American Angel!<br>
My people lived here<br>
Long, long ago!<br>
This is the history of my race!<br>
Please read the words within!<br>
We were Jews who met with Christ,<br>
But we were...<br>
All-American!<br>
<br>
But don't let anybody see these plates<br>
Except for you...<br>
They are only for you to see...<br>
Even if people ask you to show<br>
The plates to them, DON'T.<br>
Just copy them onto normal paper.<br>
Even thought this might make them<br>
Question if the plates are real, or not,<br>
This is sort of what God is going for....<br>
<br>
Joseph took the plates home,<br>
And wrote down what he found inside!<br>
He turned those plates into a book,<br>
Then rushed into town and cried:<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
Hey!  God spoke to me and gave me<br>
This blessed ancient tome!<br>
He hath commanded me to publish it,<br>
And stick it in every home!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Wow!  So the Bible is actually a trilogy,<br>
and the Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?!  I'M interested!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Now, many people didn't believe<br>
The prophet Joseph Smith.<br>
They thought he'd made up this part three<br>
That was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard!<br>
<br>
TOWNSPEOPLE:<br>
LIAR!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
But Joe said:<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
This is no lie!<br>
I speak to God all the time,<br>
And he told me to head west!<br>
So I'll take my part three<br>
From the hill with the tree,<br>
Feel free if you'd like<br>
To come along with me,<br>
To the promised land!<br>
<br>
TOWNSPEOPLE:<br>
The PROMISED LAND?<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
Paradise!<br>
On the west coast!<br>
Nothing but fruit and fields<br>
As far as the eye can see!<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
Have you heard of the<br>
All-American prophet?<br>
He found a brand new book<br>
About Jesus Christ!<br>
We're following him to paradise;<br>
We call ourselves Mormons!<br>
And our new religion is...<br>
All-American!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Wow!  How much does it cost!?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
The Mormons kept on searching for<br>
That place to settle down,<br>
But every time they thought they'd found it,<br>
They got kicked out of town!<br>
And even though people wanted<br>
To see the golden plates,<br>
Joseph never showed em!<br>
<br>
GOTSWANA:<br>
I have maggots in my scrotum.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
Um... okay.<br>
<br>
Well, anyway...<br>
<br>
Now comes the part of our story<br>
That gets a little bit sad...<br>
On the way to the promised land,<br>
Mormons made people mad.<br>
Joseph was shot by an angry mob,<br>
And knew he'd soon be done....<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
You must lead the people now,<br>
My good friend... Brigham Young.<br>
<br>
Oh, God... why are you letting me die?<br>
Without having me<br>
Show people the plates?<br>
They'll have no proof I was<br>
Telling the truth or not.<br>
They'll have to believe it just...<br>
Cause.<br>
Oh!  I guess that's kinda what you<br>
Were going for....<br>
Blargggh...<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE:<br>
The prophet Joseph Smith DIED for what he believed in.<br>
But his followers, they kept on heading west.<br>
And Brigham Young led them to paradise. A sparkling land in Utah called...<br>
Salt Lake City!<br>
And there the Mormons multiplied, and made BIG MORMON families.<br>
Generation to generation until finally... they made ME.<br>
And now it's my JOB,<br>
TO LEAD YOU WHERE THOSE EARLY SETTLERS WERE LED LONG AGO!!!<br>
<br>
TOWNSPEOPLE and PRICE:<br>
Have you heard of the All-American prophet?<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Kevin Price!!!<br>
<br>
TOWNSPEOPLE and ELDER PRICE:<br>
The next in line<br>
To be the voice of God?!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
My best friend!!!<br>
<br>
TOWNSPEOPLE, ELDER PRICE, and ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
He's gonna do something<br>
Incredible!<br>
And be Joseph Smith again!<br>
Cause Kevin Price the prophet is...<br>
All...<br>
All...<br>
All...<br>
ALL-AMERICAN-!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
If you order now, we'll also throw in a set of steak knives!<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
ALL-AMERICAN!<br>
<br>

## Sal Tlay Ka Siti  

<br>
My mama once told me of a place<br>
With waterfalls and unicorns flying<br>
Where there was no suffering, no pain<br>
Where there was laughter instead of dying<br>
I always thought she’d made it up<br>
To comfort me in times of pain<br>
But now I know that place is real<br>
Now I know its name<br>
<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>
Not just a story mama told<br>
But a village in Ooh-Tah<br>
Where the roofs are thatched with gold<br>
If I could let myself believe<br>
I know just where I’d be<br>
Right on the next bus to paradise<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>
<br>
I can imagine what it must be like<br>
This perfect, happy place<br>
I’ll bet the goat-meat there is plentiful<br>
And they have vitamin injections by the case<br>
The war-lords there are friendly<br>
They help you cross the street<br>
And there’s a Red Cross on every corner<br>
With all the flour you can eat!<br>
<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>
The most perfect place on Earth<br>
Where flies don’t bite your eyeballs<br>
And human life has worth<br>
It isn’t a place of fairytales<br>
Its as real as it can be<br>
A land where evil doesn’t exist<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>
<br>
And I’ll bet the people are open minded<br>
And don’t care who you’ve been<br>
And all I hope is that when I find it<br>
I’m able to fit in<br>
Will I fit in?<br>
<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>
A land of hope and joy<br>
And if I want to get there<br>
I just have to follow that white boy<br>
<br>
You were right, mama<br>
You didn’t lie<br>
The place is real<br>
And I’m gonna fly!<br>
<br>
I’m on way<br>
Soon life won’t be so shitty<br>
Now salvation has a name<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti<br>

## Man Up  

<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
What did Jesus do,<br>
When they sentanced him to die?<br>
Did he try to run away?<br>
Did he just break down and cry?<br>
<br>
No, Jesus dug down deep,<br>
Knowing what he had to do-<br>
When faced with his own death,<br>
Jesus knew that he had to...<br>
<br>
Man up.<br>
He had to man up.<br>
So he crawled up on that cross,<br>
And he stuck it out.<br>
And he manned up.<br>
Christ, he manned up.<br>
And taught us all what real manning<br>
Up is about!<br>
<br>
And now it's up to me<br>
And it's time to man up!<br>
Jesus had his time ta,<br>
Now it's mine ta MAN UP!<br>

'Cuz there's a time in your life<br>
When you know you've got to<br>
MAN UP.<br>

There's just one time to<br>
MAN UP.<br>
<br>
Watch me man up like<br>
Nobody else!<br>
I'm gonna man up all<br>
Over myself!<br>
I've got to get ready,<br>
It's time ta,<br>
Time ta!<br>
<br>
What did Jesus do<br>
When they put nails in his hands?<br>
Did he scream like a girl?<br>
Or did he take it like a man?<br>
When someone had to die<br>
To save us from our sins,<br>
Jesus said "I'll do it!"<br>
And he took it on the chin!<br>
<br>
He manned up!<br>
He manned up,<br>
He took a bullet for me and you,<br>
That's man up.<br>
Real man up.<br>
And now it's my time ta...<br>
DO IT TOO!<br>
<br>
Time to be a hero<br>
And slay the monster!<br>
Time to battle darkness,<br>
You're not my father!<br>

## Making Things Up Again  

<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
And lo, the Lord said unto the Nephites:<br>
"I know you're really depressed, what with all your... AIDS,<br>
and everything... but there is an answer in Christ."<br>
<br>
NABULUNGI:<br>
You see?  This book CAN help us!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
I just told a lie.<br>
No, wait, I didn't LIE...<br>
I just used my imagination...<br>
And it worked!<br>
<br>
CUNNINGHAM'S FATHER:<br>
You're making things up again, Arnold<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
But it worked, dad!<br>
<br>
CUNNINGHAM'S FATHER:<br>
You're stretching the truth again,<br>
And you know it-<br>
<br>
JOSEPH SMITH:<br>
Don't be a Fibbing Fran, Arnold.<br>

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>

And adding fiction!<br>
Be careful how you proceed, Arnold.<br>
When you fib, there's a price.<br>
<br>
MATTUMBO:<br>
Ahh, this it bullshit!<br>
The story I'VE been told is that the way to cure AIDS is by sleeping with a virgin!<br>
I'm gonna go and rape a baby!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
What?!  Oh my-NO!  You can't do that!!!  NO!<br>
<br>
MATTUMBO:<br>
Why not?!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Because that is DEFINITELY against God's will!<br>
<br>
MATTUMBO:<br>
Says who?!<br>
Where in that book of yours does it say ANYTHING about sleeping with a baby, huh?!<br>
Nowhere.<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Uh, behold!  The Lord said to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith:<br>
"You SHALL NOT have sex with that infant!"<br>
LO! Joseph said: "Why not, Lord?  Huh?  Why not?"<br>
And the Lord said "If you lay with an infant, you shall....<br>
Burn in the fiery pits of Mordar!!!"<br>
<br>
MATTUMBO:<br>
...really?<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Uh-uh... Uh-uh!  "A baby cannot cure your illness, Joseph Smith.<br>
I shall give unto you... a FROG!  And thus,<br>
Joesph laid with the frog, and his AIDS was no more!<br>
<br>
UGANDANS:<br>
Ohhhhh!<br>

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
I'm making things up again...kind of.<br>
But this time, it's helping<br>
A dozen people!<br>
It's nothing so bad, because this time,<br>
I'm not committing a sin,<br>
Just by making things up again, right?!<br>
<br>
ALL:<br>
NO!<br>
<br>
NABULUNGI:<br>
Elder Cunningham, you have to stop him!<br>

NABULUGI:<br>
Gotswana is going to cut off his daughter's clitoris!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
GOTSWANA:<br>
This is all very interesting,<br>
But women have to be circumcised if that's what the General wants!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
No, no, doing that to a lady is definitely against God's will!<br>
<br>
GOTSWANA:<br>
How do you know?!  Christ never said NOTHIN' 'bout no clitoris!<br>
<br>
ELDER CUNNINGHAM:<br>
...YES!  YES HE DID!<br>
In ancient New York, three men were about to cut off a Mormon woman's...clitoris.<br>
But...right before they did, Jesus had... BOBA FETT turn 'em into FROGS!<br>
<br>
GOTSWANA:<br>
Frogs?<br>
<br>
ASMERET:<br>
You mean like the frogs that got fucked by Joseph Smith?!<br>

Right!  Right!  Like THOSE frogs!<br>

## Spooky Mormon Hell Dream

ELDER PRICE:<br>
Long ago when I was five,<br>
I snuck in the kitchen late at night<br>
And ate a donut with a maple glaze.<br>

I said that it was my brother Jack,<br>
And Jack got grounded for 14 days.<br>
<br>
I've lived with that guilt<br>
All of my life<br>
And the terrible vision<br>
That I had that night!<br>

## I Believe  

<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
Ever since I was a child<br>
I tried to be the best...<br>
So what happened?<br>
My family and friends all said I was blessed...<br>
so what happened?<br>
<br>
It was supposed to be all so exciting.<br>
To be teaching of Christ across the sea.<br>
But I allowed my faith to be shaken-<br>
Oh, what's the matter with me?<br>
<br>
I've always longed to help the needy.<br>
To do the things I never dared.<br>
This was the time for me to step up.<br>
So then why was I so scared?<br>
<br>
A warlord that shoots people in the face.<br>
What's so scary about that?<br>
I must trust that my Lord is mightier,<br>
And always has my back.<br>
Now I must completely devout<br>
I can't have even one shred of doubt!<br>
<br>
I believe-<br>
That the Lord God created the universe.<br>
I believe-<br>
That he sent his only son to die for my sins.<br>
And I believe-<br>
That ancient Jews built boats and sailed<br>
to America.<br>
I am a Mormon.<br>
And a Mormon just believes.<br>
<br>
You cannot just believe part-way.<br>
You have to believe in it all.<br>
My problem was doubting<br>
the Lord's will.<br>
Instead of standing tall.<br>
I can't allow myself to have any doubt.<br>
<br>
It's time to set my worries free.<br>
Time to show the world<br>
What Elder Price is about.<br>
And share the power inside of me!<br>
<br>
I believe-<br>
That God has a plan for all of us.<br>
I believe-<br>
That plan involves<br>
Me getting my own planet.<br>
And I believe<br>
That the current President of the church,<br>
Thomas Monson, speaks, directly to God.<br>
I am a Mormon and, dang it,<br>
A Mormon just believes.<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
A Mormon just believes.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
I know that I must go and do-<br>
The things my God commands.<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Things my God commands.<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
I realize now why he sent me here!<br>
If you ask the Lord in faith<br>
He will always answer you just believe<br>
In him and have no fear.<br>
<br>
GUARD<br>
(spoken) General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
I believe!!!<br>
That Satan has a hold of you.<br>
I believe!<br>
That the Lord God has sent me here!<br>
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people!!<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Black People!!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
You can be a Mormon!<br>
A Mormon who just believes.<br>
<br>
GENERAL<br>
(spoken) The fuck is this?<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
And now I can feel the excitement.<br>
This is the moment I was born to do.<br>
And I feel so incredible-<br>
to be sharing my faith with you.<br>
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith,<br>
If you ask God himself you'll know.<br>
But you must ask him without any doubt,<br>
And let your spirit grow!<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Let your spirit grow!<br>
<br>
ELDER PRICE<br>
I believe!<br>
That God lives on a planet called Kolob!<br>
I believe!<br>
That Jesus has his own planet as well.<br>
And I believe<br>
That the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri.<br>
<br>
If you believe,<br>
The Lord will reveal it.<br>
And you'll know it's all true-<br>
You'll just feel it.<br>
<br>
You'll be a Mormon!!!<br>
And by gosh-<br>
A Mormon just belieeeeeeeeves!!!!<br>
Oh, I believe!<br>
I believe!<br>
<br>
CHORUS<br>
Believe!<br>
<br>

## Joseph Smith American Moses  

<br>
And now we wish to honor you with the story of Joseph Smith,<br>
the American Moses!<br>
Well this is very good, Praise Christ.<br>
Mormon!<br>
I’m going to take you back in time! (Mormon)<br>
To the United States year 1823. (Mormon)<br>
A small and odd village called Oopstate New York. (Oopstate)<br>
There was Disease, and famine (so sick)<br>
But also in the village lived a simple farmer who would change everything<br>
His name was Joseph Smith.<br>
<br>
Ha-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith, American Moses!<br>
Praise be to Joseph! American prophet man.<br>
<br>
AY! My name is Joseph Smith,<br>
and I’m going to fuck this baby!<br>
<br>
What?!<br>
<br>
No no Joseph! Don’t fuck the baby!<br>
Joseph Smith, don’t fuck the baby.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the clouds parted,<br>
And Joseph Smith was visited by GOD!<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith, do not fuck a baby.<br>
I’ll get rid of your AIDS, if you fuck this frog.<br>
<br>
Ha-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith fucked the frog god gave him,<br>
And his AIDS went away!<br>
Then a great wizard named Moronai came down<br>
from the starship enterprise<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith! Your village is shit!<br>
You should lead the villagers to a new village.<br>
Take these fucking golden plates (awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay)<br>
<br>
And on the plates were written the directions to a new land.<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)<br>
Joseph tried to convince all the villagers<br>
to follow him and his golden plates.<br>
<br>
Liberation! Equality!<br>
No more slavery for oopstate Mormon people!<br>
<br>
I got de golden plates! (gold plates)<br>
I gunna lead the people! (we head west)<br>
We gotta stick together! (Mormons)<br>
We gotta hel’ eachother! (we are Mormons)<br>
And so we climb the mountain! (we head west)<br>
And we cross the river (we head west)<br>
And we fight the oppression! (Mormons)<br>
By being nice to everyone (we are Mormons)<br>
<br>
Not so fast Mormons! You shall not pass my mountain!<br>
(Down from the mountain look who comes!<br>
The American warlord, Brigham Young!<br>
YES! I am Brigham Young!<br>
I cut off my daughters clitoris.<br>
That made god angry so he turned my nose into a clit for punishment!<br>
<br>
(Brigham Young, his nose was a clitoris.<br>
What will you do Joseph? Will you fight the clitoris man?)<br>
<br>
Not fight him, help him! (oooohhhhhhhh)<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith took his magical fuck frog<br>
and rubbed it upon Brigham Young's clit-face,<br>
And behold, Brigham was cured!<br>
<br>
Joseph Smith! Magical AIDS frog!<br>
Brigham Young! Frog on his clit-face!<br>
<br>
Brigham Young was so grateful,<br>
He decided to join the Mormons and their journey.<br>
<br>
Compassion!<br>
Courtesy!<br>
Let’s be really fucking polite to everyone!<br>
<br>
I got de golden plates! (gold plates)<br>
I gunna lead the people! (we head west)<br>
We gotta stick together! (Mormons)<br>
<br>
Now comes the part of our story that gets a little bit sad. (ohh)<br>
After travelling for so long,<br>
The Mormons ran out of fresh water,<br>
And became sick, with dysentery!<br>
<br>
(Water go to the water,water go to the cup.<br>
Cup go to the stomach, shit come out the butt.<br>
Shit go in the water, water go in the cup.<br>
Shit go down the stomach, shit come out the butt.)<br>
<br>
Oh fuck!<br>
<br>
Oh no! The prophet Joseph smith is now getting sick!<br>
<br>
(Shit go in the water, water go in the cup.<br>
Cup go to the thirsty, shit go to the stomach.<br>
Blood come out the butt, blood go in the water.<br>
Water go in the cup, cup go to the tongue.<br>
Shit blood in the stomach, shit blood in the mouth.<br>
Shit blood on the insides, water come out the butt.)<br>
<br>
Brigham Young,<br>
You must take the golden plates<br>
and lead the Mormons to the promise land!<br>
<br>
Desperation!<br>
Mortality!<br>
Loss of faith!<br>
I…………… got the golden plates (gold plates)<br>
I gunna lead the people (we head west)…<br>
<br>
Even though their prophet had died,<br>
The Mormons stuck together,<br>
And helped each other,<br>
And were really nice to everyone they came across.<br>
And one day, the Mormons finally found,<br>
Sal Tlay Ka Siti! (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)<br>
And then, the Mormons danced with Ewoks,<br>
And were greeted by Jesus!<br>
<br>
Welcome Mormons!<br>
Now, let’s all have as many babies as we can,<br>
And make big, Mormon families!<br>
<br>
Woohoo!<br>
Fuck your woman, fuck your man,<br>
It is all part of gods plan<br>
Mormons help god as they can,<br>
Here in Sal Tlay Ka Siti land!<br>
<br>
Thank you!  Thank you,<br>
Now we are fucking.<br>
Thank you! Thank you,<br>
God wants us fucking.<br>
Thank you! Thank you,<br>
Get back to fucking.<br>
Thank you! Thank you, GOD.<br>
<br>
(Joseph Smith fuck frog. Brigham Young clit face.<br>
Shit come out the butt. Jesus says fuck, fuck, Mormons!)<br>
