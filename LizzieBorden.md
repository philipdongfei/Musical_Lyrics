# Lizzie Borden

## Forty Whacks (Prologue) - Company

ENSEMBLE
Lizzie Borden took an axe
Gave her mother forty whacks
When she saw what she had done
Gave her father forty-one

ALICE (spoken)
I am Alice Russel.
I have lived in Fall River a good many years.
All that time the Bordens have occupied the house next door.
I exchanged calls with Miss Lizzie Borden regularly.
She always received me upstairs

BRIDGET (spoken)
The name's Bridget Sullivan.
I was sometimes called "Maggie" by Miss Emma and Miss Lizzie,
It bein' the name of the previous girl.
I came to Fall River four years ago,
Have worked for the Bordens ever since

EMMA (spoken)
My full name is Emma L. Borden. The L is for Lenora.
I am the sister of Miss Lizzie Borden.
I was just a trifle over fourteen
When my father married for the second time,
And I remember my mother very well

LIZZIE (spoken)
My name is is Lizzie Andrew Borden. Not Elizabeth, Lizzie.
Andrew -- after my father I was so christened.
I am innocent.
I leave it to my council to speak for me


## The House Of Borden - Company

In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door;
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war.
Let us take you to an August back 1892.
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden...

Andrew Jackson Borden knows that pennies must be pinched,
So Monday's mutton supper will be Tuesday's mutton lunch.
And then to stretch it further, Thursday's breakfast is mutton soup,
And were getting sick in the House of Borden...
When daddy was an undertaker, no body was too tall;
He'd charge 'em for the big box and bury them in the small.
To save a couple of dollars, he'd chop off a couple feet...
He's fucking rich, that Mr. Borden!

In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door;
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war.
Let us take you to an August back 1892.
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden...

The sisters live in the front of the house, the old folks take the rear;
It seems a bit peculiar but they've kept it up for years.
I won't say they're not cordial; crowded's more the word.
They get no peace in the House of Borden...
Lizzie's not the brightest bird and Emma's not so sweet;
Mind you, these are not my words, but I hear things on the street.
Anyway you slice it, these girls are past there prime.
There's no wedding bells in the House of Borden...

In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door;
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war.
Let us take you to an August back 1892.
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden....

Father married Mrs. Borden after our mother died.
If she's in it for the money, she's in for a big surprise;
We've no personal objection, BUT SHE CAN'T HAVE WHAT'S OURS!
Fair is fair in the House of Borden....

The family crest of Borden is a lion with an axe,
Running rampant into battle, ready to attack.
It's an oddly fitting emblem for a family like this
And were killing time in the House of Borden (Killing time) .

In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door;
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war.
Let us take you to an August back 1892.
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden....

When I was a girl, I have my father my gold ring.
He wears it to this day, a symbol of my love for him.
My middle name is Andrew; Father wanted a boy.
But I'm Daddy's Little Girl now.

The father loved the younger one, some say a bit too much.
They say she talks to pigeons, but who am I to judge?
I don't mean to spread a rumor, these are just things that I hear.
But there's some crazy shite in the House of Borden...


## This is Not Love - Lizzie

This, this, this is not love.
I don't know what it is.
But I know this, this is not love.
You touch with selfish hands.
This is not love.
You speak in cold demands.
This is not love.
Whatever you take, it isn't giving.
When I, I have no choice.
What kind of life am I living,
if I, I have no voice?
I don't know what it is.

Sometimes you say the words,
but this is not love.
After thought apologies are not enough,
to make me believe,
make me forgive you,
repair the damage done.
It isn't enough,
to say you're sorry
and still have your fun.

I want to feel that I can fall
and not be made to feel a fool.
I wanna look up
and see a bright light shining through.
To see arms outstretched to hold me,
wanting nothing in return,
but only for me to feel
safe and secure.
Is that too much to ask for?
Is it so wrong to want more than this?

Because this, this,
this is not love.
Oh, this is not love.
This is not love.
This is not love.
This is not love.
I don't know what it is,
but I want out of it.

## I Gotta Get Out Of Here - Lizzie and Alice

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Alice!

ALICE (spoken)
Are you alright?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Yes, I-I'm fine

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie, what happened?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Nothing, I just-

ALICE (spoken)
Are you have troubles again with your-?

LIZZIE (spoken)
No, Alice-!

(sung)
I gotta get out of here!

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie! Lizzie, listen to me!

LIZZIE

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie, you can tell me anything!

LIZZIE
I gotta

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie, I won't give you away

LIZZIE
I gotta
I

There's something hangin' over me
This thunderstorm I can't see
But I know it's there
I gotta get out of here

Oh, Alice, I'm afraid tonight
'Cause something doesn't feel quite right
Out there in the dark

This feeling comes over me
At times, no matter where I am
And I know if I stay here longer
It's gonna turn out bad

I gotta get out of here
I gotta get out of here
I gotta get out of here
I gotta
I gotta
I gotta
I gotta

I gotta go anew and have
What all the uptown people have
Don't I deserve it?

I gotta get out of here
I wanna go and disappear
But sis and me, we're stuck down here
And it's killing me

I wanna know who I am
Free and clear
I just don't know how

I used to hope it'd be different
No more pain and fear
But hope is disappearing now

Uh!
I gotta
I gotta
Uh, uh, I gotta
Uh, uh, uh, I gotta

And this feeling comes over me
At times, no matter where I am

ALICE
Stay here longer!

LIZZIE
And I know if I stay here longer
It's gonna turn out bad
I gotta get out of here
I gotta
I gotta
I gotta
I gotta get out of here!


## If You Knew - Alice

Always standing in your wake
With a secret of my own
Too afraid to share with you
So I come home alone
Each night and draw the curtain, shut the blind
How will you trust me with your secret when I don’t trust you with -

If you knew
Knew how I’ve been watching you
If you knew
Knew how I see everything you do
If you knew
Could I still touch you?
Would you let me comfort you if you knew?

The room is hot, the air is thick
And I can barely breathe tonight
Open the window, trim the wick
Oh, this cannot be right
For it seems to me a secret’s just a lie
And Lizzie, no-one knows the emptiness of lying more than -

If you knew
Knew that every night I dream of you
If you knew
Knew that in my dream I come to you
If you knew
Would you still touch me?
Would you tell me everything if you knew?

Together we’ll be safe
The truth will make it so
Just like my dream each night
For in my dream I know
That you are in my arms and everything is fine
Oh, Lizzie, take me to your hiding-place and I’ll take you to -

If you knew
Knew that in my heart I always knew
If you knew
Knew that every word I spoke was true
If you knew
i could protect you
Would you let me hold you close if you knew?

## The Soul Of The White Bird - Company

LIZZIE
Who are these that fly
Like a cloud to my window?
Coming with the waxing of a moon

To the beating of your wings
And the violins of freedom
I love you
I am hopeful
Am I doomed?

I clamor and I moan
That house is not my home
My silver wings are pinioned with green gold
My ghost
My dove
My innocence
My love
Am I utterly forgotten?
Left alone

LIZZIE (spoken)
The boys
Wanna come
Wanna play
With my pigeons
And you never let the boys come, boys come, boys come
Hand on my knee, on my... never let the boys come
Chasing all the boys away
I feel myself disintegrate
Oh, please daddy, please daddy
If I stay with you, daddy
Fingers on my knee, daddy
Stop it, stop it, stop it, daddy
Fingers on my, fingers on my, boys pigeons fingers daddy
Stop it
Stop it
Daddy

BRIDGET
And if there are survivors
They will be on the mountain
Like doves of the valley
All of them moaning

ALL
Oh, that I had wings like a dove
I would fly away
Be at rest

LIZZIE (spoken)
Lock away your secrets
Lock away my life
What if I unlocked your secrets
To your stupid little wife?
I want a new dress, daddy!
Need some money for a new dress
New dress daddy money please daddy please
I want a new dress
Dress like all the girls up on the hill
And all the boys and pretty dresses
Pretty dresses, pretty boys and girls
Come 'round to the pretty houses pretty penny
Hand on my knee, on my fingers, on my, pretty penny

BRIDGET
And the soul of the white bird
On the wings of six black birds
Will be carried in the night
To the mountain

ALL
Oh, Lord, do not deliver
The soul of the white bird
The soul of the white bird
To the wild beast

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie, don't!

LIZZIE (spoken)
Is that you, Alice?

ALICE (spoken)
Yes. Lizzie, I've been looking all over for you

LIZZIE (spoken)
Are you alone?

ALICE (spoken)
Yes

LIZZIE (spoken)
Then come up. Come up and see them.
Father says birds are filthy, but I think they're beautiful

## Maybe Someday - Alice

ALICE
Maybe someday
Your heart will be open
Maybe someday
You will know
Maybe someday
I will make you see
That your secret's safe now

LIZZIE
My secret's safe now

ALICE
Your secret's safe now
With me


## "The Will" - Company

## Sweet Little Sister - Company

Emma:
I was a trembling child, just twelve years old,
When Mother placed you in my arms.
You were only two, you never knew,
My sweet, little sister.
She touched my face and she pulled me close.
Then Mama whispered in my ear,
"Don't let her go, don't let her know,
Your sweet, little sister."
For years I tried to be to you all the things she was to me.
I tried to give you all the love you needed.
But now I feel, with out a word,
I've told you everything.
And now I hear a warning, and it must be heeded.
Sweet, little sister, I'm so afraid to leave you.
Sweet, little sister, I've got to get away.
I was a dark sought girl of 14 years,
When Father married his new wife.
You were only four,
So I kept score my sweet little sister.
She touched his face and pulled him close.

Lizzie, overlapping:
Huh-huh-huh

Emma:
And then she whispered in his ear,

Lizzie, overlapping:
Huh-huh-huh

Both:
He let us go, she runs the show,
My sweet little sister.

Lizzie:
For years I tried to keep you safe
from the darkness in my heart.
But now I see my troubles were detected.

Emma:
I look into your cold,
Green eyes and they tell me everything.
Now I know that no one's been protected.
Sweet, little sister. What I don't see.

Lizzie:
What you don't see.

Emma:
Sweet, little sister, I could never hurt you.

Lizzie:
No never hurt you.
Sweet sister, what you don't know.

Emma:
What I don't know.
Sweet, little sister, I can never show.
Sweet, little sister, I'm so afraid to leave you.
Sweet, little sister, I'm more afraid to stay.
Sweet, little sister, I'm scared of what may happen.
Sweet, little sister, I've got to get away.
I've got to get away.
I've got to get away.


## Shattercane And Velvet Grass - Company

Bridget:
Fire burn, and toil
Kettle bubble, water boil.
Assam, Salem,
Bitter trouble, very strong

Lizzie: (spoken)
Prussic acid is one of the most rapidly acting toxins
which affects mammals.

Bridget:
Black leaves, and steep
Settle cozy, dark as sleep
Oh soothe this day
Milk and sugar, cup o’ tea

Lizzie: (spoken)
Several common plants can accumulate large quantities.

Lizzie, counterpoint to Bridget: (spoken)
Shattercane and velvet grass,
Sorghum and white clover,
Millipedes and bergamot,
Flax when winter’s over.
Cherry stones and apricots,
Pale and milky silent
Poison for it’s Prussian blue..

Bridget, counterpoint to Lizzie:
Fire burn, and toil
Kettle bubble, water boil.
Assam, Salem,
Bitter trouble, very strong.
Black leaves, and steep
Settle cozy, dark as sleep
Oh soothe this day
Milk and sugar, cup o’ tea

Lizzie:
Ferric phenyl cyanide, 300 parts per million.
Prussic acid, blue-ish clear, protoplasmic poison.
Boils at 26 degrees and faintly tastes of almonds.
Death is by paralysis of heart and respiration.
Passes through unbroken skin.
Careful, for it’s found within…

Shattercane and velvet grass,
Sorghum and white clover,
Millipedes and bergamot,
Flax when winter’s over.
Cherry stones and apricots,
Pale and milky silent
Poison for it’s Prussian blue,
Beautiful and violent.

Following directions in the Book of Household Poisons.
Just a drop dropped in the milk
And hope that she’ll enjoy some.
Mind you don’t forget to close your eyes and hold your breath.
But
Wouldn’t it be easy, now?
A perfect little death.
Just drop a grain into her tea,
Mrs Borden, R.I.P.

## "The Milk" - Lizzie and Alice

## Will You Stay? - Lizzie and Alice

LIZZIE (spoken)
I'm afraid somebody will do something.
I don't know what, but somebody will do something

(sung)
I want to sleep
With my eyes half open
One eye open half the time

ALICE
But if you close your eyes you'll see
The golden pear it hides the key
That can open up your heart
And end your toil
See how they ripen on the bough
Now they're falling to the ground
To be gathered up in skirts
Before they soil

Will you lay next to me
In the shade of the tree
Will you bite through the skin
To the sweet flesh within
Will you rest a while
Let me bring back your smile
Will you lay next to me
Will you stay

LIZZIE (spoken)
I've ought to be on my way

ALICE
The pear is jealous of the rose
Because she hears of all your woes
But she never gets a chance
To taste your pleasure
And though she's luscious to the taste
She's always eaten in great haste
For the autumn winds that blow
Steal all her treasure

Will you lay next to me
In the shade of the tree
Will you bite through the skin
To the sweet flesh within
Will you rest a while
Let me bring back your smile
Will you lay next to me
Will you stay

Sleep sleep sleep
I'll keep my eyes half open
One eye open all the time


## Why Are All These Heads Off? - Bridget, Lizzie and Alice

BRIDGET (spoken)
Miss Lizzie, your father doesn't want you nor Miss Russell
up in the barn no more

LIZZIE (spoken)
Maggie? What do you have there?

BRIDGET
Listen to me, Lizzie, it's bad
And I don't know how to say this
But your father saw you in the barn
He saw you go up there with Alice

He said, "I told her to leave those birds alone
They're sick and dark and filthy"
Then he took an axe and chopped their heads off
One by one he killed them

LIZZIE
The sound of beating pigeon wings
Is ringing in my ears
And the taste of blood is on my tongue
And it's been rising up for years

My world is growing darker
He is shutting out the light
There's no way out of this pressure cooker
No way out alive

BRIDGET, LIZZIE, ALICE
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?

ALICE
Why? Why? Why?

BRIDGET, LIZZIE, ALICE
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads

ALICE
Wait, wait, wait
Everything is fine, Lizzie
We will find a better way
If you stay with me, Lizzie
I will protect you

BRIDGET
There are two sides, Lizzie
You didn't choose what side you're on

ALICE
But there is right!

BRIDGET
And there is wrong!

LIZZIE
And I will choose my weapon!

BRIDGET, LIZZIE, ALICE
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?

ALICE
Why? Why? Why?

BRIDGET, LIZZIE, ALICE
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?
Why are all these heads off?

ALICE
Why? Why? Why?

LIZZIE
I'm standing looking forward in the dark
A feeling brushes past me
And I know the wind has changed

## Mercury Rising - Company

BRIDGET
Air stands still
Thick with rain
And it hasn't yielded
Thunder rumbles low
But still no storm

Foul winds blow
Leave a strange
Metallic aftertaste
And carry whispers
Too soft to hear

Mercury rises
As the drops
Of stifled rage
Collecting weight
Begin to fall

BRIDGET, LIZZIE
Ahh

BRIDGET
Ancestral blood
Stains a daughter's
Ivory hand
And splatter o'er
The reeking floor

## Somebody Will Do Something - Company

BRIDGET
Somebody will do something
Somebody will take something
Somebody will strike something
Somebody will die

LIZZIE
Axe Fall River runs red!

Maggie's washing windows
Father takes a walk
Stepmother goes upstairs
And I can hardly talk
I'm so afraid
I went down to the cellar
And searched behinds some stacks
My eyes they never say it
But my hands they found the axe
I'm so afraid

ALL
Somebody will do something
Somebody will take something
Somebody will strike something
Somebody will die

LIZZIE
I step onto the staircase
Stepmother hears me not
I step into the bedroom
Oh Lizzie, what have you got
I'm so afraid

EMMA
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here
Gotta get out of here

ALL
Somebody will do something
Somebody will take something
Somebody will strike something
Somebody will die

BRIDGET (spoken)
Oh, miss Lizzie! You startled me!
Mr. Borden's just come home,
he said to keep the noise down.
He'll be napping in the living room
and doesn't want to be disturbed

LIZZIE (spoken)
Maggie, you are going out this afternoon?

BRIDGET (spoken)
Oh, I don't know. I might and I might not.
I don't feel very well

LIZZIE (spoken)
If you go out make sure to lock the door
for Mrs. Borden has gone out on a sick call
and I might go out too

BRIDGET (spoken)
Miss Lizzie, who is sick?

LIZZIE (spoken)
I don't know. Somebody

BRIDGET (spoken)
Somebody?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Yes. She had a note from somebody this morning.
It must be in town.
There is a cheap sale of dresses at Sergeant's this afternoon.
Pennies on the yard

BRIDGET (spoken)
I'm going to have a lovely one

LIZZIE
With Maggie so retired
Stepmother quite undone
Father will be napping
He'll wish he had that son
I'm so afraid

ALL
Somebody will do something
Somebody will take something
Somebody will strike something
Somebody will
Somebody will die

LIZZIE (spoken)
Maggie! Go and get Miss Russell.
I don't want to be alone in this house

BRIDGET (spoken)
What's the matter?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Father is dead.
Somebody came in and killed him

## "Forty Whacks"(Entr’acte) - Band


## The Fall Of The House Of Borden/"The Alibi" - Bridget, Lizzie and Alice

BRIDGET
In the house of Borden
Somebody left us quite a mess
Splattered blood and brains on everything
Except on Lizzie's dress

It's a crime scene, it's a nightmare
It's a bloodbath, it's a fright
It's a butcher's shop in the house of Borden

A mob is gathering outside
Half the town is in the yard
The press is in a frenzy
Cops are standing guard

It must've been a lunatic
A foreigner, a beast
But it's just us girls in the house of Borden

LIZZIE (spoken)
I was in the backyard

ALICE (spoken)
Did you see anyone or hear anything?

LIZZIE (spoken)
I saw no one. Heard no screams

ALICE (spoken)
Where were you in the yard?

LIZZIE (spoken)
I was up in the barn loft

ALICE (spoken)
Why would you go up there after... what happened?

LIZZIE (spoken)
I went out to get a... lead sinker for my fishing trip.
I heard a distressing noise, like scraping,
And came back and found the screen door open

ALICE (spoken)
How long were you up there?

LIZZIE (spoken)
Twenty minutes?

ALICE (spoken)
It must've been sweltering!

LIZZIE (spoken)
I ate some pears

BRIDGET
Lizzie was in the backyard
Or did she say the barn?
It's only been a day now
And she's spinning quite a yarn

What we know for sure
Is there were four and now there's two
There's no coming back to the house of Borden

In the house of Borden
Somebody left us quite a mess
Splattered blood and brains on everything
Except on Lizzie's dress

It's a crime scene, it's a nightmare
It's a bloodbath, it's a fright
And it blew the roof off the house of Borden

We laid them out in the dining room
It's going on day two
I know it sounds disgusting
But it's 1892

There's no AC
It's August
And it's ninety-five degrees
Well, you do the math

Lizzie: My hands are red but I wear a heart so wide.
Both: Who would've thought the old man had so much blood in him?
Emma: What's done is done, but there's a knocking at the gate.
Gotta clean up the scene, gotta act like we're normal.
Get your shit together, get your story straight.
Gotta talk to a cop, gotta cry at a funeral.
What the fuck! What the fuck, what the fuck,
What the fuck now Lizzie?!
Lizzie: Well he ain't gonna lock all the doors now is her?
Emma: What the fuck! What the fuck,
What the fuck, what the fuck now, Lizzie?
Emma: Well she ain't gonna get all the dough now is she? No.

Lizzie: Well, he ain't coming round in the dark now is he?
Both: No (4 times)
Lizzie: Sister, put on your nightgown- got to bed.
Emma: Gotta figure out a plan, gotta spring into action.

Gonna sleep tonight in sweet satisfaction.

ALICE
Did she go to the barn

LIZZIE
Did you laugh on stairs

ALICE
Was there blood on her hands
What did she wear

BRIDGET
Was she wearing a blue dress

ALICE
Was it stained at the hem

EMMA
She change it to a new one

ALICE
See blood on the skirt

LIZZIE
Are you sure just a drop

ALICE
Did she burn the thing up

## Will You Lie? - Company

ALICE
Stop, stop, stop
The lies are all half-spoken
Half-lies spoken all the time

LIZZIE
But if you close your eyes you'll see
My golden pear, you hide a key
That can lock a secret in and never tell

The fruit of sin weighed on the bough
Somebody came in and cut them down
Now they've fallen to the ground with no farewell

Will you lie here for me
With your lips silently?
Will you bite through the skin
To the sweet truth within?
Will you rest for a while?
Let me bring back your smile
Will you lie here for me?
Will you stay?

ALICE
The pear is frightened of the rose
For now your thorns are all she knows
And she's seen the pain
That comes with your displeasure
And though the prick is most unkind
You think it leaves no trace behind
But it leaves a drop of blood
Upon the measure

LIZZIE
Will you lie here for me
With your lips silently?
Will you bite through the skin
To the sweet truth within?
Will you bite through the skin
To the sweet truth within?
Will you rest for a while?
Let me bring back your smile
Will you lie here for me?
Here for me
Are you?
Will you
Stay?
Stay
Will you?

(spoken)
What are you going to tell them?

ALICE (spoken)
The truth

LIZZIE (spoken)
The truth? I want to know the truth

ALICE (spoken)
I saw you. I saw miss Lizzie Borden burn that dress!


## Watchmen For The Morning - Bridget, Emma and Lizzie

EMMA & LIZZIE
Out of the depths I cry to thee
Lord, Lord hear my voice
Let thy ears be attentive
To the voice of my prayer

My soul waits for the Lord
And in his word I hope
My soul waits for the Lord
More than watchmen
For the morning

LIZZIE (spoken)
Emma, are you going to give me away?

EMMA (spoken)
No Lizzie, I won't

LIZZIE (spoken)
Yes you will. But I will let you see.
I won't give in one inch

EMMA & LIZZIE
If thou should mark iniquities
Lord, Lord who could stand
But there is forgiveness with thee
That thou may be feared

My soul it waits
It waits for the Lord
And in
And in his word I hope
My soul waits for the Lord
More than watchmen
For the morning
More than watchmen
For the morning
More than watchmen
For the morning

## Maybe Someday (Reprise 1) / Thirteen Days In Taunton - Company

LIZZIE (spoken)
My name is Lizzie Andrew Borden. Not Elizabeth.
Lizzie. Andrew, after my father,
I was so christened. I am innocent.
I leave it to my council to speak for me

(sung)
Maybe someday
I'll walk in the open

EMMA (spoken)
My full name is Emma L. Borden,
I am the sister of miss Lizzie Borden

LIZZIE
Maybe someday
We'll all forget

BRIDGET (spoken)
The name's Bridget Sullivan.
I was sometimes called Maggie by miss Emma and miss Lizzie

LIZZIE
Maybe someday
They won't whisper point and stare

ALICE (spoken)
I am Alice Russell

LIZZIE
But my secret's safe now

ALICE (spoken)
I exchanged calls with miss Lizzie Borden regularly.
She always received me upstairs

LIZZIE
My secret's
Safe
Now

ALICE (spoken)
Lizzie spoke of trouble with her stepmother.
That Mrs. Borden thought so-and-so.
But the whole thing was, as far as I could see,
that one's own mother might've had more influence over the father.
It was the father more than the mother.
They were young girls.
But young girls cannot go and do and have

LIZZIE
They tried to keep me down
But I said no
I'm moving uptown honey
It's where I'm gonna go
But I'm down here in the big house
Help me count the days
I've got thirteen days in Taunton
Then I'll fly away

EMMA (spoken)
I have no recollection of anything of that kind.
No sir, I don't seem to remember it.
I don't remember what you asked me.
I don't remember the question, nor the answer.
I can only say I don't remember giving it.
I don't know whether I did or not, I can't tell you.
I don't know. I was in Fairhaven

LIZZIE
I got my dream team workin'
On my defense
It cost me a bloody fortune
But I spared no expense
'Cause let me tell you
Losing is not a game I play
I'll be leaving by the front door
When I fly away
I got twelve more days in Taunton
And then I'll fly away
I got
Then I'll fly away

ALICE (spoken)
About seven o'clock on the evening of Wednesday,
August third I was waiting for miss Lizzie Borden.
But when she came she said-

BRIDGET (spoken)
She was on her way
to Benson's pharmacy for prussic acid.
To clean a stain

ALICE (spoken)
She said "Mr. and Mrs. Borden were awfully sick last night.
We were all sick, all but Maggie."

BRIDGET (spoken)
I had a sick headache and I was sick to my stomach

ALICE (spoken)
And she said Mrs. Borden even told the doctor
she thought she had been poisoned.
I asked her who would do something like that and she didn't know.
She said "I can't sleep at night.
I'm that afraid somebody will do something."

EMMA & LIZZIE
Now that you mention it I
Can't stand the night
I sit here in the darkness
Waiting for the light

LIZZIE
Eleven days in Taunton waiting
For the break of day
Ten more days in this hole
Then I'll fly away

They love me in the jailhouse
They love me in the street
They love me in the courtroom
Yeah I know I got 'em beat
I got nine more days in Taunton

ALICE
This
This
This is not love
I don't know what it is

LIZZIE
When this whole thing is over
I've got to get away

EMMA (spoken)
Well, I don't know how to describe it to you

BRIDGET (spoken)
It was not a Calico dress

ALICE (spoken)
It was a cheap cotton Bedford cord

EMMA (spoken)
An American cloth

ALICE (spoken)
All cotton

EMMA (spoken)
I think one part of it was black or very-

BRIDGET (spoken)
Light blue

ALICE (spoken)
With a small dark figure

BRIDGET (spoken)
A sprig

ALICE (spoken)
I did not suggest to miss Lizzie Borden that she change her dress

EMMA (spoken)
I think she did

ALICE (spoken)
I saw no blood on that dress. Not a drop

LIZZIE
Can we just drop the dress talk
The subject's getting dull

LIZZIE & BRIDGET
Gonna buy myself a brand new dress
Gonna buy a whole damn closet full
'Cause I got plenty of money
Girl, I just got paid

LIZZIE
Four more days in Taunton
Then I'll fly away

BRIDGET (spoken)
After Mrs. Borden told me to wash the windows,
I didn't see her anymore until I found her dead on the upstairs.
I don't remember to have heard a sound
Of anyone about the house until Mr. Borden came to the door.
As I unlocked it I said "Oh,
P'shaw" and miss Lizzie laughed at the top of the stairs

LIZZIE
You say that I'm not weeping
That I'm not dressed in black
Call me a Yankee Clytemnestra
Well imagine that
I've done my share of crying
Lord my dues is paid
I got three more days in Taunton
Then I'll fly away

ALICE (spoken)
Her sister turned and said "What are you going to do?"

EMMA (spoken)
I swear I didn't say it.
The reason I say I didn't say so is because I didn't say so

ALICE (spoken)
And Lizzie said "I'm going to burn this old thing up."

EMMA (spoken)
There was nothing of that kind said

ALICE (spoken)
It was covered in-

EMMA (spoken)
Paint! It was soiled, just as any dress would get soiled
And I said "Why don't you?" or something like that.
I can't tell the exact words

ALICE (spoken)
I am quite sure I left the room and told the officer
That I saw miss Lizzie Borden burn that dress

ALICE & LIZZIE
Turn of the century
Turn of the screw
Turn of the tables
Between me and you

LIZZIE
Got two more days in Taunton
Until my judgement day
One more day in Taunton
Then I'll fly away

They take me to the courthouse
The verdict's coming in
It only took an hour
For those white-haired gentlemen
To put this all behind me
Oh, today's the day
When the old man says

VOICEOVER
"Not guilty!"

LIZZIE
Watch me fly away

EMMA
Maybe someday

LIZZIE
I'll walk in the open

EMMA
Maybe someday

LIZZIE
We'll all forget

EMMA
Maybe someday

LIZZIE
They won't whisper point and stare but my secret's safe now

EMMA
Yes your secret's safe

EMMA & LIZZIE
Our secret's safe now
Maybe someday
We'll tell the world
Maybe someday
We'll make them understand

ALICE
Maybe someday
You'll come back to me

EMMA
But your secret's safe now

ALICE & BRIDGET
Her secret's safe now

EMMA
Our secret's safe

BRIDGET
Our secret's safe

ALICE
Our secret's safe

ALICE, BRIDGET, EMMA
Now

Two, three, four!

Gave her mother forty whacks

Gave her father forty-one
