ALICE (spoken) <br>
I am Alice Russel. <br>

All that time the Bordens have occupied the house next door. <br>
I exchanged calls with Miss Lizzie Borden regularly. <br>
She always received me upstairs <br>
 <br>

Have worked for the Bordens ever since <br>

And I remember my mother very well <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
My name is is Lizzie Andrew Borden. Not Elizabeth, Lizzie. <br>

## The House Of Borden - Company 
 <br>
In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door; <br>
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war. <br>
Let us take you to an August back 1892. <br>
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden... <br>
 <br>
Andrew Jackson Borden knows that pennies must be pinched, <br>
So Monday's mutton supper will be Tuesday's mutton lunch. <br>
And then to stretch it further, Thursday's breakfast is mutton soup, <br>
And were getting sick in the House of Borden... <br>
When daddy was an undertaker, no body was too tall; <br>
He'd charge 'em for the big box and bury them in the small. <br>
To save a couple of dollars, he'd chop off a couple feet... <br>
He's fucking rich, that Mr. Borden! <br>
 <br>

In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war. <br>
Let us take you to an August back 1892. <br>
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden... <br>
 <br>
The sisters live in the front of the house, the old folks take the rear; <br>
It seems a bit peculiar but they've kept it up for years. <br>
I won't say they're not cordial; crowded's more the word. <br>
They get no peace in the House of Borden... <br>
Lizzie's not the brightest bird and Emma's not so sweet; <br>
Mind you, these are not my words, but I hear things on the street. <br>
Anyway you slice it, these girls are past there prime. <br>
There's no wedding bells in the House of Borden... <br>
 <br>
In the House of Borden, there's a lock on every door; <br>
In every room a prisoner of a long, silent war. <br>
Let us take you to an August back 1892. <br>
When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden.... <br>
 <br>
Father married Mrs. Borden after our mother died. <br>
If she's in it for the money, she's in for a big surprise; <br>
We've no personal objection, BUT SHE CAN'T HAVE WHAT'S OURS! <br>
Fair is fair in the House of Borden.... <br>
 <br>
The family crest of Borden is a lion with an axe, <br>
Running rampant into battle, ready to attack. <br>
It's an oddly fitting emblem for a family like this <br>
And were killing time in the House of Borden (Killing time) . <br>
 <br>

When all Hell broke loose in the House of Borden.... <br>
 <br>
When I was a girl, I have my father my gold ring. <br>
He wears it to this day, a symbol of my love for him. <br>
My middle name is Andrew; Father wanted a boy. <br>
But I'm Daddy's Little Girl now. <br>
 <br>
The father loved the younger one, some say a bit too much. <br>
They say she talks to pigeons, but who am I to judge? <br>
I don't mean to spread a rumor, these are just things that I hear. <br>
But there's some crazy shite in the House of Borden... <br>
 <br>
 <br>
## This is Not Love - Lizzie 
 <br>
This, this, this is not love. <br>
I don't know what it is. <br>
But I know this, this is not love. <br>
You touch with selfish hands. <br>
This is not love. <br>
You speak in cold demands. <br>
This is not love. <br>
Whatever you take, it isn't giving. <br>
When I, I have no choice. <br>
What kind of life am I living, <br>
if I, I have no voice? <br>
I don't know what it is. <br>
 <br>
Sometimes you say the words, <br>
but this is not love. <br>
After thought apologies are not enough, <br>
to make me believe, <br>
make me forgive you, <br>
repair the damage done. <br>
It isn't enough, <br>
to say you're sorry <br>
and still have your fun. <br>
 <br>
I want to feel that I can fall <br>
and not be made to feel a fool. <br>
I wanna look up <br>
and see a bright light shining through. <br>
To see arms outstretched to hold me, <br>
wanting nothing in return, <br>
but only for me to feel <br>
safe and secure. <br>
Is that too much to ask for? <br>
Is it so wrong to want more than this? <br>
 <br>
Because this, this, <br>
this is not love. <br>
Oh, this is not love. <br>
This is not love. <br>
This is not love. <br>
This is not love. <br>
I don't know what it is, <br>
but I want out of it. <br>

There's something hangin' over me <br>
This thunderstorm I can't see <br>
But I know it's there <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
 <br>
Oh, Alice, I'm afraid tonight <br>
'Cause something doesn't feel quite right <br>
Out there in the dark <br>
 <br>
This feeling comes over me <br>
At times, no matter where I am <br>
And I know if I stay here longer <br>
It's gonna turn out bad <br>
 <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
I gotta <br>
I gotta <br>

I gotta go anew and have <br>
What all the uptown people have <br>
Don't I deserve it? <br>
 <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
I wanna go and disappear <br>
But sis and me, we're stuck down here <br>
And it's killing me <br>
 <br>
I wanna know who I am <br>
Free and clear <br>
I just don't know how <br>
 <br>
I used to hope it'd be different <br>
No more pain and fear <br>
But hope is disappearing now <br>
 <br>
Uh! <br>
I gotta <br>
I gotta <br>
Uh, uh, I gotta <br>
Uh, uh, uh, I gotta <br>
 <br>
And this feeling comes over me <br>
At times, no matter where I am <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
Stay here longer! <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
And I know if I stay here longer <br>
It's gonna turn out bad <br>
I gotta get out of here <br>
I gotta <br>
I gotta <br>
I gotta <br>
I gotta get out of here! <br>

## If You Knew - Alice 
 <br>
Always standing in your wake <br>
With a secret of my own <br>
Too afraid to share with you <br>
So I come home alone <br>
Each night and draw the curtain, shut the blind <br>
How will you trust me with your secret when I don’t trust you with - <br>
 <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew how I’ve been watching you <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew how I see everything you do <br>
If you knew <br>
Could I still touch you? <br>
Would you let me comfort you if you knew? <br>
 <br>
The room is hot, the air is thick <br>
And I can barely breathe tonight <br>
Open the window, trim the wick <br>
Oh, this cannot be right <br>
For it seems to me a secret’s just a lie <br>
And Lizzie, no-one knows the emptiness of lying more than - <br>
 <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew that every night I dream of you <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew that in my dream I come to you <br>
If you knew <br>
Would you still touch me? <br>
Would you tell me everything if you knew? <br>
 <br>
Together we’ll be safe <br>
The truth will make it so <br>
Just like my dream each night <br>
For in my dream I know <br>
That you are in my arms and everything is fine <br>
Oh, Lizzie, take me to your hiding-place and I’ll take you to - <br>
 <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew that in my heart I always knew <br>
If you knew <br>
Knew that every word I spoke was true <br>
If you knew <br>
i could protect you <br>
Would you let me hold you close if you knew? <br>
 <br>
## The Soul Of The White Bird - Company 
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Who are these that fly <br>
Like a cloud to my window? <br>
Coming with the waxing of a moon <br>
 <br>
To the beating of your wings <br>
And the violins of freedom <br>
I love you <br>
I am hopeful <br>
Am I doomed? <br>
 <br>
I clamor and I moan <br>
That house is not my home <br>
My silver wings are pinioned with green gold <br>
My ghost <br>
My dove <br>
My innocence <br>
My love <br>
Am I utterly forgotten? <br>
Left alone <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
The boys <br>
Wanna come <br>
Wanna play <br>
With my pigeons <br>
And you never let the boys come, boys come, boys come <br>
Hand on my knee, on my... never let the boys come <br>
Chasing all the boys away <br>
I feel myself disintegrate <br>
Oh, please daddy, please daddy <br>
If I stay with you, daddy <br>
Fingers on my knee, daddy <br>
Stop it, stop it, stop it, daddy <br>
Fingers on my, fingers on my, boys pigeons fingers daddy <br>
Stop it <br>
Stop it <br>
Daddy <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
And if there are survivors <br>
They will be on the mountain <br>
Like doves of the valley <br>
All of them moaning <br>
 <br>
ALL <br>
Oh, that I had wings like a dove <br>
I would fly away <br>
Be at rest <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Lock away your secrets <br>
Lock away my life <br>
What if I unlocked your secrets <br>
To your stupid little wife? <br>
I want a new dress, daddy! <br>
Need some money for a new dress <br>
New dress daddy money please daddy please <br>
I want a new dress <br>
Dress like all the girls up on the hill <br>
And all the boys and pretty dresses <br>
Pretty dresses, pretty boys and girls <br>
Come 'round to the pretty houses pretty penny <br>
Hand on my knee, on my fingers, on my, pretty penny <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
And the soul of the white bird <br>
On the wings of six black birds <br>
Will be carried in the night <br>
To the mountain <br>
 <br>
ALL <br>
Oh, Lord, do not deliver <br>
The soul of the white bird <br>
The soul of the white bird <br>
To the wild beast <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Lizzie, don't! <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Is that you, Alice? <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Yes. Lizzie, I've been looking all over for you <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Are you alone? <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Yes <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Then come up. Come up and see them. <br>
Father says birds are filthy, but I think they're beautiful <br>
 <br>

ALICE <br>
Maybe someday <br>
Your heart will be open <br>
Maybe someday <br>
You will know <br>
Maybe someday <br>
I will make you see <br>
That your secret's safe now <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
My secret's safe now <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
Your secret's safe now <br>
With me <br>

 <br>
Emma: <br>
I was a trembling child, just twelve years old, <br>
When Mother placed you in my arms. <br>
You were only two, you never knew, <br>
My sweet, little sister. <br>
She touched my face and she pulled me close. <br>
Then Mama whispered in my ear, <br>
"Don't let her go, don't let her know, <br>
Your sweet, little sister." <br>
For years I tried to be to you all the things she was to me. <br>
I tried to give you all the love you needed. <br>
But now I feel, with out a word, <br>
I've told you everything. <br>
And now I hear a warning, and it must be heeded. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I'm so afraid to leave you. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I've got to get away. <br>
I was a dark sought girl of 14 years, <br>
When Father married his new wife. <br>
You were only four, <br>
So I kept score my sweet little sister. <br>
She touched his face and pulled him close. <br>
 <br>
Lizzie, overlapping: <br>
Huh-huh-huh <br>
 <br>
Emma: <br>
And then she whispered in his ear, <br>
 <br>
Lizzie, overlapping: <br>
Huh-huh-huh <br>
 <br>
Both: <br>
He let us go, she runs the show, <br>
My sweet little sister. <br>
 <br>
Lizzie: <br>
For years I tried to keep you safe <br>
from the darkness in my heart. <br>
But now I see my troubles were detected. <br>
 <br>
Emma: <br>
I look into your cold, <br>
Green eyes and they tell me everything. <br>
Now I know that no one's been protected. <br>
Sweet, little sister. What I don't see. <br>
 <br>
Lizzie: <br>
What you don't see. <br>
 <br>
Emma: <br>
Sweet, little sister, I could never hurt you. <br>
 <br>
Lizzie: <br>
No never hurt you. <br>
Sweet sister, what you don't know. <br>
 <br>
Emma: <br>
What I don't know. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I can never show. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I'm so afraid to leave you. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I'm more afraid to stay. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I'm scared of what may happen. <br>
Sweet, little sister, I've got to get away. <br>
I've got to get away. <br>
I've got to get away. <br>

Following directions in the Book of Household Poisons. <br>
Just a drop dropped in the milk <br>
And hope that she’ll enjoy some. <br>
Mind you don’t forget to close your eyes and hold your breath. <br>
But <br>
Wouldn’t it be easy, now? <br>

## Will You Stay? - Lizzie and Alice 
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I'm afraid somebody will do something. <br>
I don't know what, but somebody will do something <br>
 <br>
(sung) <br>
I want to sleep <br>
With my eyes half open <br>
One eye open half the time <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
But if you close your eyes you'll see <br>
The golden pear it hides the key <br>
That can open up your heart <br>
And end your toil <br>
See how they ripen on the bough <br>
Now they're falling to the ground <br>
To be gathered up in skirts <br>
Before they soil <br>
 <br>
Will you lay next to me <br>
In the shade of the tree <br>
Will you bite through the skin <br>
To the sweet flesh within <br>
Will you rest a while <br>
Let me bring back your smile <br>
Will you lay next to me <br>
Will you stay <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I've ought to be on my way <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
The pear is jealous of the rose <br>
Because she hears of all your woes <br>
But she never gets a chance <br>
To taste your pleasure <br>
And though she's luscious to the taste <br>
She's always eaten in great haste <br>
For the autumn winds that blow <br>
Steal all her treasure <br>
 <br>
Will you lay next to me <br>
In the shade of the tree <br>
Will you bite through the skin <br>
To the sweet flesh within <br>
Will you rest a while <br>
Let me bring back your smile <br>
Will you lay next to me <br>
Will you stay <br>
 <br>
Sleep sleep sleep <br>
I'll keep my eyes half open <br>
One eye open all the time <br>

## Why Are All These Heads Off? - Bridget, Lizzie and Alice
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Miss Lizzie, your father doesn't want you nor Miss Russell <br>
up in the barn no more <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Maggie? What do you have there? <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
Listen to me, Lizzie, it's bad <br>
And I don't know how to say this <br>
But your father saw you in the barn <br>
He saw you go up there with Alice <br>
 <br>
He said, "I told her to leave those birds alone <br>
They're sick and dark and filthy" <br>
Then he took an axe and chopped their heads off <br>
One by one he killed them <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
The sound of beating pigeon wings <br>
Is ringing in my ears <br>
And the taste of blood is on my tongue <br>
And it's been rising up for years <br>
 <br>
My world is growing darker <br>
He is shutting out the light <br>
There's no way out of this pressure cooker <br>
No way out alive <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET, LIZZIE, ALICE <br>
Why are all these heads off? <br>
Why are all these heads off? <br>
Why are all these heads off? <br>

Everything is fine, Lizzie <br>
We will find a better way <br>
If you stay with me, Lizzie <br>
I will protect you <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
There are two sides, Lizzie <br>
You didn't choose what side you're on <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
But there is right! <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
And there is wrong! <br>

A feeling brushes past me <br>
And I know the wind has changed <br>

## Mercury Rising - Company 
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
Air stands still <br>
Thick with rain <br>
And it hasn't yielded <br>
Thunder rumbles low <br>
But still no storm <br>
 <br>
Foul winds blow <br>
Leave a strange <br>
Metallic aftertaste <br>
And carry whispers <br>
Too soft to hear <br>
 <br>
Mercury rises <br>
As the drops <br>
Of stifled rage <br>
Collecting weight <br>
Begin to fall <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET, LIZZIE <br>
Ahh <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
Ancestral blood <br>
Stains a daughter's <br>
Ivory hand <br>
And splatter o'er <br>
The reeking floor <br>
 <br>
## Somebody Will Do Something - Company
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
Somebody will do something <br>
Somebody will take something <br>
Somebody will strike something <br>
Somebody will die <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Axe Fall River runs red! <br>
 <br>
Maggie's washing windows <br>
Father takes a walk <br>
Stepmother goes upstairs <br>
And I can hardly talk <br>
I'm so afraid <br>
I went down to the cellar <br>
And searched behinds some stacks <br>
My eyes they never say it <br>
But my hands they found the axe <br>
I'm so afraid <br>
 <br>
ALL <br>
Somebody will do something <br>
Somebody will take something <br>
Somebody will strike something <br>
Somebody will die <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
I step onto the staircase <br>
Stepmother hears me not <br>
I step into the bedroom <br>
Oh Lizzie, what have you got <br>
I'm so afraid <br>
 <br>

BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Oh, miss Lizzie! You startled me! <br>
Mr. Borden's just come home, <br>
he said to keep the noise down. <br>
He'll be napping in the living room <br>
and doesn't want to be disturbed <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Maggie, you are going out this afternoon? <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Oh, I don't know. I might and I might not. <br>
I don't feel very well <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
If you go out make sure to lock the door <br>
for Mrs. Borden has gone out on a sick call <br>
and I might go out too <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Miss Lizzie, who is sick? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I don't know. Somebody <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Somebody? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Yes. She had a note from somebody this morning. <br>
It must be in town. <br>
There is a cheap sale of dresses at Sergeant's this afternoon. <br>
Pennies on the yard <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
I'm going to have a lovely one <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
With Maggie so retired <br>
Stepmother quite undone <br>
Father will be napping <br>
He'll wish he had that son <br>
I'm so afraid <br>
 <br>
ALL <br>
Somebody will do something <br>
Somebody will take something <br>
Somebody will strike something <br>
Somebody will <br>
Somebody will die <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Maggie! Go and get Miss Russell. <br>
I don't want to be alone in this house <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
What's the matter? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Father is dead. <br>
Somebody came in and killed him <br>

## The Fall Of The House Of Borden/"The Alibi" - Bridget, Lizzie and Alice 
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
In the house of Borden <br>
Somebody left us quite a mess <br>
Splattered blood and brains on everything <br>
Except on Lizzie's dress <br>
 <br>
It's a crime scene, it's a nightmare <br>
It's a bloodbath, it's a fright <br>
It's a butcher's shop in the house of Borden <br>
 <br>
A mob is gathering outside <br>
Half the town is in the yard <br>
The press is in a frenzy <br>
Cops are standing guard <br>
 <br>
It must've been a lunatic <br>
A foreigner, a beast <br>
But it's just us girls in the house of Borden <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I was in the backyard <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Did you see anyone or hear anything? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I saw no one. Heard no screams <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Where were you in the yard? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I was up in the barn loft <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Why would you go up there after... what happened? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I went out to get a... lead sinker for my fishing trip. <br>
I heard a distressing noise, like scraping, <br>
And came back and found the screen door open <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
How long were you up there? <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
Twenty minutes? <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
It must've been sweltering! <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
I ate some pears <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET <br>
Lizzie was in the backyard <br>
Or did she say the barn? <br>
It's only been a day now <br>
And she's spinning quite a yarn <br>
 <br>
What we know for sure <br>
Is there were four and now there's two <br>
There's no coming back to the house of Borden <br>
 <br>
In the house of Borden <br>
Somebody left us quite a mess <br>
Splattered blood and brains on everything <br>
Except on Lizzie's dress <br>
 <br>
It's a crime scene, it's a nightmare <br>
It's a bloodbath, it's a fright <br>
And it blew the roof off the house of Borden <br>
 <br>
We laid them out in the dining room <br>
It's going on day two <br>
I know it sounds disgusting <br>
But it's 1892 <br>
 <br>
There's no AC <br>
It's August <br>
And it's ninety-five degrees <br>
Well, you do the math <br>

## What The Fuck Now, Lizzie? - Emma and Lizzie 
 <br>
Lizzie: Emma? Is that you? <br>
Emma: My sweet little sister, what have you done? <br>
Lizzie: Well I wasn't gonna wait for an engraved invitation. <br>
Emma: Now I've got twice the trouble, got two for one. <br>
Lizzie: Stop your bitchin', can't you see a win-win situation? <br>
Emma: What the fuck?! <br>
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck now, Lizzie?! <br>
Lizzie: Well he ain't crawling back into bed now is he? <br>
Emma: No <br>
Lizzie, my love, is this the best that you could do? <br>
Damned, if I leave you alone for a minute! <br>
What possessed you to murder the old man too? <br>
Made a deal, had a plan, and an axe wasn't in it! <br>
What the fuck! What the fuck, what the fuck, <br>
What the fuck now, Lizzie?! <br>
Lizzie: Well he ain't comin' round in the dark now is he? <br>
Emma: What the fuck! What the fuck, what the fuck, <br>
What the fuck now Lizzie?! <br>
Lizzie: And she ain't gonna get all the dough now is she? <br>
Emma: No. <br>
Lizzie: No. <br>
Both: No, no. <br>
Lizzie: A foolish, not to say, a sorry sight. <br>
Emma: Did he look? Did he blink? Did he know who did him? <br>
Lizzie: My hands are red but I wear a heart so wide. <br>
Both: Who would've thought the old man had so much blood in him? <br>
Emma: What's done is done, but there's a knocking at the gate. <br>
Gotta clean up the scene, gotta act like we're normal. <br>
Get your shit together, get your story straight. <br>
Gotta talk to a cop, gotta cry at a funeral. <br>
What the fuck! What the fuck, what the fuck, <br>
What the fuck now Lizzie?! <br>
Lizzie: Well he ain't gonna lock all the doors now is her? <br>
Emma: What the fuck! What the fuck, <br>
What the fuck, what the fuck now, Lizzie? <br>
Emma: Well she ain't gonna get all the dough now is she? No. <br>
(Emma continues her "What the Fuck"s <br>
and Lizzie continues her "No"s 3 times.) <br>
Lizzie: Well, he ain't coming round in the dark now is he? <br>
Both: No (4 times) <br>
Lizzie: Sister, put on your nightgown- got to bed. <br>
Emma: Gotta figure out a plan, gotta spring into action. <br>
Lizzie: Ain't nobody home but the sleeping and the dead. <br>
Gonna sleep tonight in sweet satisfaction. <br>

LIZZIE <br>
But if you close your eyes you'll see <br>
My golden pear, you hide a key <br>
That can lock a secret in and never tell <br>
 <br>
The fruit of sin weighed on the bough <br>
Somebody came in and cut them down <br>
Now they've fallen to the ground with no farewell <br>
 <br>
Will you lie here for me <br>
With your lips silently? <br>
Will you bite through the skin <br>

Will you rest for a while? <br>

Will you lie here for me? <br>
Will you stay? <br>

The pear is frightened of the rose <br>
For now your thorns are all she knows <br>
And she's seen the pain <br>
That comes with your displeasure <br>
And though the prick is most unkind <br>
You think it leaves no trace behind <br>
But it leaves a drop of blood <br>
Upon the measure <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Will you lie here for me <br>
With your lips silently? <br>
Will you bite through the skin <br>

LIZZIE (spoken) <br>
My name is Lizzie Andrew Borden. Not Elizabeth. <br>
Lizzie. Andrew, after my father, <br>
I was so christened. I am innocent. <br>
I leave it to my council to speak for me <br>
 <br>
(sung) <br>
Maybe someday <br>
I'll walk in the open <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
My full name is Emma L. Borden, <br>
I am the sister of miss Lizzie Borden <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Maybe someday <br>
We'll all forget <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
The name's Bridget Sullivan. <br>
I was sometimes called Maggie by miss Emma and miss Lizzie <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Maybe someday <br>
They won't whisper point and stare <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
I am Alice Russell <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
But my secret's safe now <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
I exchanged calls with miss Lizzie Borden regularly. <br>
She always received me upstairs <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
My secret's <br>
Safe <br>
Now <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Lizzie spoke of trouble with her stepmother. <br>
That Mrs. Borden thought so-and-so. <br>
But the whole thing was, as far as I could see, <br>
that one's own mother might've had more influence over the father. <br>
It was the father more than the mother. <br>
They were young girls. <br>
But young girls cannot go and do and have <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
They tried to keep me down <br>
But I said no <br>
I'm moving uptown honey <br>
It's where I'm gonna go <br>
But I'm down here in the big house <br>
Help me count the days <br>
I've got thirteen days in Taunton <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
I have no recollection of anything of that kind. <br>
No sir, I don't seem to remember it. <br>
I don't remember what you asked me. <br>
I don't remember the question, nor the answer. <br>
I can only say I don't remember giving it. <br>
I don't know whether I did or not, I can't tell you. <br>
I don't know. I was in Fairhaven <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
I got my dream team workin' <br>
On my defense <br>
It cost me a bloody fortune <br>
But I spared no expense <br>
'Cause let me tell you <br>
Losing is not a game I play <br>
I'll be leaving by the front door <br>
When I fly away <br>
I got twelve more days in Taunton <br>
And then I'll fly away <br>
I got <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
About seven o'clock on the evening of Wednesday, <br>
August third I was waiting for miss Lizzie Borden. <br>
But when she came she said- <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
She was on her way <br>
to Benson's pharmacy for prussic acid. <br>
To clean a stain <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
She said "Mr. and Mrs. Borden were awfully sick last night. <br>
We were all sick, all but Maggie." <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
I had a sick headache and I was sick to my stomach <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
And she said Mrs. Borden even told the doctor <br>
she thought she had been poisoned. <br>
I asked her who would do something like that and she didn't know. <br>
She said "I can't sleep at night. <br>
I'm that afraid somebody will do something." <br>
 <br>
EMMA & LIZZIE <br>
Now that you mention it I <br>
Can't stand the night <br>
I sit here in the darkness <br>
Waiting for the light <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Eleven days in Taunton waiting <br>
For the break of day <br>
Ten more days in this hole <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
They love me in the jailhouse <br>
They love me in the street <br>
They love me in the courtroom <br>
Yeah I know I got 'em beat <br>
I got nine more days in Taunton <br>
 <br>
ALICE <br>
This <br>
This <br>
This is not love <br>
I don't know what it is <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
When this whole thing is over <br>
I've got to get away <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
Well, I don't know how to describe it to you <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
It was not a Calico dress <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
It was a cheap cotton Bedford cord <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
An American cloth <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
All cotton <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
I think one part of it was black or very- <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
Light blue <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
With a small dark figure <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
A sprig <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
I did not suggest to miss Lizzie Borden that she change her dress <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
I think she did <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
I saw no blood on that dress. Not a drop <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Can we just drop the dress talk <br>
The subject's getting dull <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE & BRIDGET <br>
Gonna buy myself a brand new dress <br>
Gonna buy a whole damn closet full <br>
'Cause I got plenty of money <br>
Girl, I just got paid <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Four more days in Taunton <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
BRIDGET (spoken) <br>
After Mrs. Borden told me to wash the windows, <br>
I didn't see her anymore until I found her dead on the upstairs. <br>
I don't remember to have heard a sound <br>
Of anyone about the house until Mr. Borden came to the door. <br>
As I unlocked it I said "Oh, <br>
P'shaw" and miss Lizzie laughed at the top of the stairs <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
You say that I'm not weeping <br>
That I'm not dressed in black <br>
Call me a Yankee Clytemnestra <br>
Well imagine that <br>
I've done my share of crying <br>
Lord my dues is paid <br>
I got three more days in Taunton <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
Her sister turned and said "What are you going to do?" <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
I swear I didn't say it. <br>
The reason I say I didn't say so is because I didn't say so <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
And Lizzie said "I'm going to burn this old thing up." <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
There was nothing of that kind said <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
It was covered in- <br>
 <br>
EMMA (spoken) <br>
Paint! It was soiled, just as any dress would get soiled <br>
And I said "Why don't you?" or something like that. <br>
I can't tell the exact words <br>
 <br>
ALICE (spoken) <br>
I am quite sure I left the room and told the officer <br>
That I saw miss Lizzie Borden burn that dress <br>
 <br>
ALICE & LIZZIE <br>
Turn of the century <br>
Turn of the screw <br>
Turn of the tables <br>
Between me and you <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Got two more days in Taunton <br>
Until my judgement day <br>
One more day in Taunton <br>
Then I'll fly away <br>
 <br>
They take me to the courthouse <br>
The verdict's coming in <br>
It only took an hour <br>
For those white-haired gentlemen <br>
To put this all behind me <br>
Oh, today's the day <br>
When the old man says <br>
 <br>
VOICEOVER <br>
"Not guilty!" <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
Watch me fly away <br>
 <br>
EMMA <br>
Maybe someday <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
I'll walk in the open <br>
 <br>
EMMA <br>
Maybe someday <br>
 <br>
LIZZIE <br>
We'll all forget <br>

EMMA <br>
Maybe someday <br>
